//! Post-authentication admission gates.
//!
//! An [`AdmissionGate`] is a coarse, pluggable check run once per request
//! immediately after authentication and actor resolution — instance-admin
//! membership and assumed-role are already resolved — and before the request
//! reaches any handler. It can reject a *validated* principal that must not be
//! admitted to this instance at all, for example by consulting an external
//! control-plane permission service.
//!
//! This is deliberately a distinct layer from:
//! - **authentication** (is the token valid — answered by the
//!   [`Authenticator`](limes::Authenticator)), and
//! - **authorization** (may this actor perform action X on resource Y —
//!   answered per-endpoint by the [`Authorizer`](crate::service::authz::Authorizer)).
//!
//! Keeping it separate means a gate can return the right HTTP semantics (a
//! denial is not an authentication failure, and "permission service
//! unreachable" is not a `401`), runs *after* the instance-admin break-glass is
//! resolved, and sees the full [`RequestMetadata`].
//!
//! Gates are composed as a list ([`AdmissionGates`]) and evaluated in
//! registration order; the first rejection wins and short-circuits the rest.
//! The default — no gates configured — admits every request, so existing
//! deployments are unaffected.
