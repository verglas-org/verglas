# Generic Tables

Lakekeeper's **Generic Table API** catalogs non-Iceberg tables — Lance, CSV, Parquet, or any other format — alongside Iceberg tables in the same Warehouse. Each generic table sits in a Namespace, has a name, a `format` string, an optional base `location`, `schema`, `statistics`, `properties`, and a free-form `doc` field. Engines handle writes against the underlying format; Lakekeeper handles **identity, governance, access control, and lifecycle**.

Unlike Iceberg tables, Lakekeeper does not commit format-specific metadata for generic tables — readers and writers go directly to the storage location after obtaining catalog metadata and credentials. This makes the API format-agnostic: any future or experimental format works without changes to the catalog.

## When to use generic tables

- **Raw landing zones** — register CSV, JSON, or Parquet drops so they show up in the same catalog and inherit the same permissions as downstream Iceberg tables.
- **Lance for multimodal AI** — store text, image embeddings, raw bytes, and scalar features in one table, then run vector + SQL queries via LanceDB, DuckDB, or Polars. See the example below.
- **Experimental formats** — prototype new file/table formats behind the same `/credentials`, soft-delete, and authorization plumbing as production Iceberg tables.

## Capabilities

Generic tables are first-class citizens. Most of Lakekeeper's table-side machinery applies:

| Feature | Generic tables | Notes |
|---------|:--------------:|-------|
| Credentials vending (S3, GCS, Azure) | :white_check_mark: | `GET /lakekeeper/v1/{prefix}/namespaces/{ns}/generic-tables/{t}/credentials` |
| [Remote signing](#remote-signing-s3-without-sts) (S3) | :white_check_mark: | For S3 storages without STS. See below |
| [Soft-deletion](./concepts.md#soft-deletion) + undrop | :white_check_mark: | Respects per-warehouse soft-delete settings |
| [Protection](./concepts.md#protection) flag | :white_check_mark: | `protected: bool` on load response; toggle via `GET/POST /management/v1/warehouse/{wh}/generic-table/{id}/protection`. Drops require `force=true` when set. |
| Rename | :white_check_mark: | `POST /lakekeeper/v1/{prefix}/generic-tables/rename` |
| Listing + pagination | :white_check_mark: | Same cursor scheme as Iceberg tables |
| Per-action permissions | :white_check_mark: | 16 distinct actions (`drop`, `undrop`, `read_data`, `write_data`, `get_metadata`, `rename`, `change_ownership`, grant-* relations, ...) |
| [Case-insensitive identifiers](./concepts.md#identifier-case-sensitivity) | :white_check_mark: | Cross-engine name resolution applies |
| Name uniqueness across types | :white_check_mark: | A generic table cannot collide with an Iceberg table or view in the same Namespace |
| Stored schema / statistics fields | :white_check_mark: | Free-form JSON; informational only |
| Format-agnostic | :white_check_mark: | `format` is an opaque string |
| Commit coordination | :x: | The catalog does not arbitrate writes — engines write directly |
| Schema enforcement | :x: | Schema is stored, not validated against data files |

## Working with generic tables

The flow is the same for every format: create the table, load it with *vended* credentials, then read or write directly with the format's own library. Lakekeeper only brokers metadata and short-lived storage credentials — never the data itself — so the same credentials path works for any format and only the reader library changes.

You don't need to hand-roll these HTTP calls:

- **Python** — the [Python client (`pylakekeeper`)](generic-tables-pylakekeeper.md) wraps create/load/list/drop and maps vended credentials into the keys Lance, `boto3`, and `fsspec` expect. See its [Lance example](generic-tables-pylakekeeper.md#lance).
- **PySpark** — [Apache Spark](generic-tables-spark.md) reads and writes generic tables through the same vending flow.
- **Java / Flink** — [Apache Flink](generic-tables-flink.md) shows the same vending flow.

For a runnable end-to-end example (warehouse setup, STS credentials, create/load/drop, undrop, listing), see [`tests/integration-tests/lance/test_lance.py`](https://github.com/lakekeeper/lakekeeper/blob/main/tests/integration-tests/lance/test_lance.py).

### Remote signing (S3 without STS)

Vended credentials need an STS endpoint. Some S3-compatible storages (for example Scaleway, or OVH) don't offer one. Then [remote signing](./storage.md#s3) is the only way to grant access, and it works for generic tables exactly as it does for Iceberg tables.

Nothing extra needs to be configured on the table: as long as the warehouse's S3 storage profile has `remote-signing-enabled` set to `true`, the load and credentials responses of a generic table carry the signing properties in their `config`:

| Property | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `s3.remote-signing-enabled` | `true` — the client should sign through Lakekeeper |
| `signer.uri` (and legacy `s3.signer.uri`) | Base URI of the sign endpoint |
| `signer.endpoint` (and legacy `s3.signer.endpoint`) | Path of the sign endpoint for this generic table, `v1/signer/{warehouse-id}/tabular-id/{generic-table-id}/v1/aws/s3/sign` |

As with Iceberg tables, whether signing or vended credentials is offered depends on the `X-Iceberg-Access-Delegation` header and the storage profile — see [Disabling Credential Vending & Remote Signing](./storage.md#disabling-credential-vending-remote-signing). Request `remote-signing` explicitly if your client supports both and the storage has no STS.

The client then sends each S3 request it wants to make to that endpoint and receives the `Authorization` headers back. Lakekeeper authorizes every signing request against the generic table's own permissions:

- `GET` / `HEAD` require `read_data` on the generic table
- `PUT` / `POST` / `DELETE` require `write_data` on the generic table

Only requests whose URI lies within the generic table's `base-location` are signed; anything else is rejected. Views are never signable.

Client-side support varies. PySpark and Java engines use the properties above automatically. Format libraries that talk to S3 through their own client (Lance, for example) generally expect static credentials and do not implement the Iceberg signer protocol, so for those, prefer a storage that supports STS-vended credentials.

## In the Console

The Lakekeeper Console lists generic tables alongside Iceberg tables and views inside each Namespace, tagged with their `format` so you can tell them apart at a glance. Selecting one opens a detail view with its location, schema, statistics, properties, and the same actions (rename, protect, drop/undrop, permissions) available for Iceberg tables.

Because the `format` field is an opaque string, any format shows up as a first-class entry — below are a few common ones.

### Lance

Multimodal / vector tables written with Lance. The detail view surfaces the stored schema (embeddings, scalar features, raw bytes) and the storage location engines read from.

### Delta

Delta Lake tables cataloged as generic tables — governed and permissioned in Lakekeeper while engines read/write the Delta log directly at the table location.

### Dataset

A raw dataset (CSV / JSON / Parquet drop) registered so it appears in the catalog and inherits the surrounding Namespace's permissions.

## Authorization model

Generic tables have an OpenFGA object type (`lakekeeper_generic_table`) parallel to `lakekeeper_table` and `lakekeeper_view`. Permissions inherit from the parent Namespace and Warehouse, and can be granted to users or roles via the standard `/management/v1/permissions/generic-table/{id}` endpoints. See [Authorization](./authorization.md).

Because grants are per-action, you can — for example — give an ML platform service `read_data` and `get_metadata` on every generic table in a namespace without granting `drop` or `change_ownership`.

## Limits

- The catalog does not coordinate concurrent writes. If your format requires commit coordination, the engine or the format library is responsible.
- Schema and statistics fields are informational. Engines that need an authoritative schema should read it from the underlying files.
- Generic tables and Iceberg tables share the namespace's identifier space — a name conflict across types is rejected at create time.
