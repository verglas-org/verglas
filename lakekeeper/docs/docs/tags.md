# Governance Tags

Governance tags let you attach a controlled vocabulary of labels — `pii`, `sensitivity=restricted`, `deprecated` — to catalog objects (Warehouses, Namespaces, Tables, Views, Generic Tables, and columns). They are metadata for classification, discovery, and access control.

!!! warning "Preview"
    This API is in preview and may change in a backward-incompatible way in a future release.

!!! note "Not Iceberg snapshot tags"
    These are **management-plane** governance tags, applied through the `/management/v1/...` API. They are unrelated to Iceberg's native table-snapshot *tags* (named snapshot references created with `ALTER TABLE ... CREATE TAG`), which live in table metadata and are managed through the data-plane catalog API.

## Concepts

A tag has two parts:

- A **tag definition** — the project-scoped vocabulary entry: a name, what kinds of value it may carry, and which object types it may be applied to. Defined once per project.
- A **tag attachment** — a definition applied to a specific object, optionally with a value. The same definition can be attached to many objects.

Separating the two means the set of allowed tags is governed centrally, while applying them can be delegated per definition.

## Tag definitions

Create a definition by `POST`ing to `/management/v1/tag-definition`:

```json
{
  "name": "sensitivity",
  "description": "Data sensitivity level",
  "scope": ["table", "column"],
  "value-kind": "enumerated",
  "allowed-values": ["public", "internal", "restricted"]
}
```

- **`name`** — unique within the project, case-insensitively. `.` is a hierarchy delimiter (e.g. `pii.classification`); a name may not begin or end with `.` or contain empty segments.
- **`scope`** — the object types the definition may be attached to: any of `warehouse`, `namespace`, `table`, `view`, `generic-table`, `column`. Attaching to an out-of-scope object type is rejected.
- **`value-kind`** — how values are constrained (see below).

### Value kinds

| `value-kind` | Meaning | Value on apply |
|---|---|---|
| `marker` | Presence-only; the tag carries no value (e.g. `pii`, `deprecated`). | Must be omitted. |
| `free-text` | An arbitrary string, up to 256 characters. | Required. |
| `enumerated` | One of a fixed `allowed-values` set (case-sensitive, exact match). | Required; must be an allowed value. |

`allowed-values` is required (non-empty) for `enumerated` definitions and must be omitted otherwise. Each allowed value is likewise capped at 256 characters.

### Evolving a definition

`POST /management/v1/tag-definition/{id}` updates a definition, with guardrails that keep already-applied tags valid:

- **`scope` can only be widened** — the new scope must contain every currently configured type. Removing a scope that objects are already tagged under is rejected.
- **`add-allowed-values`** adds to an enumerated definition's set; existing values are never removed.
- **`value-kind` is immutable.**

`DELETE /management/v1/tag-definition/{id}` removes a definition, but only once no object references it — detaching all attachments first is required.

### Who may define tags

- Creating definitions requires the project's **tag-creator** capability (or a project security admin). This delegates vocabulary creation without granting broader administrative rights.
- Managing an *existing* definition — updating, deleting, or delegating who may apply it — keys off the definition's **ownership** (or a project security admin), not tag-creator.

See [Authorization](authorization.md) for the capability model.

## Applying tags to objects

Attach a tag with `PUT .../tags/{tag_name}`, carrying the value in the body (omit it for a `marker`):

```http
PUT /management/v1/warehouse/{warehouse_id}/table/{table_id}/tags/sensitivity
{ "value": "restricted" }
```

The full set of attachment endpoints, one per object type:

| Object | Path |
|---|---|
| Warehouse | `/management/v1/warehouse/{warehouse_id}/tags/{tag_name}` |
| Namespace | `/management/v1/warehouse/{warehouse_id}/namespace/{namespace_id}/tags/{tag_name}` |
| Table | `/management/v1/warehouse/{warehouse_id}/table/{table_id}/tags/{tag_name}` |
| Column | `/management/v1/warehouse/{warehouse_id}/table/{table_id}/column/{column_name}/tags/{tag_name}` |
| View | `/management/v1/warehouse/{warehouse_id}/view/{view_id}/tags/{tag_name}` |
| Generic Table | `/management/v1/warehouse/{warehouse_id}/generic-table/{generic_table_id}/tags/{tag_name}` |

Each supports `PUT` (attach or update the value), `DELETE` (detach), and `GET` (list the object's tags). Objects are addressed by UUID; tags and columns by name.

**Applying is idempotent.** Re-applying the same value is a no-op — it does not change the attachment's timestamp. Applying a *different* value updates it in place.

### Who may apply tags

Attaching a tag to an object requires **both**:

- the **manage-tags** capability on the target object (independent of write/DDL rights, so classification can be separated from data ownership), and
- the **apply** capability on the tag definition — a per-definition delegation point for "who may apply *this* tag".

## Effective (inherited) tags

Tags applied high in the hierarchy apply to everything beneath. Pass `?effective=true` to any tag-list endpoint to get an object's **effective** tags — its own tags plus those inherited from its ancestors:

```http
GET /management/v1/warehouse/{warehouse_id}/table/{table_id}/tags?effective=true
```

- **Inheritance runs down the containment chain**: a Table/View/Generic Table inherits from its Namespace chain and Warehouse; a Namespace inherits from parent Namespaces and the Warehouse.
- **Most-specific wins**: if the same definition is attached at several levels, the nearest attachment's value is returned; the rest are shadowed.
- **Columns are direct-only** — a column's effective tags are exactly its own; it does not inherit its table's tags.
- Each returned tag carries an **`inherited-from`** field naming the ancestor it came from; it is absent for the object's own (direct) tags.

Effective tags are gated only on your access to the **queried object**: an inherited tag is part of that object's effective governance, so anyone who can read the object's tags sees them, values included. Granting someone tag-read access to a sub-object therefore also exposes the tags it inherits from above.

## Finding where a tag is used

To list every object a definition is attached to, use the reverse lookup:

```http
GET /management/v1/tag-definition/{tag_definition_id}/attachments?value=restricted
```

- Results are keyset-paginated; the optional `value` filter narrows to a single value.
- This is gated more strictly than reading one object's tags — it requires the definition's **owner** or a project **security admin**, because enumerating every object a tag touches is a broad disclosure.

!!! note "Direct attachments only"
    The reverse lookup returns objects the definition is attached to **directly**. It does not expand inheritance, so it will not list objects that merely *inherit* the tag from an ancestor. A completeness sweep ("which objects are effectively `pii`?") must also account for inherited tags via the effective-tags view above.
