# Configuration

Lakekeeper is configured via environment variables. Settings listed in this page are shared between all projects and warehouses. Previous to Lakekeeper Version `0.5.0` please prefix all environment variables with `ICEBERG_REST__` instead of `LAKEKEEPER__`.

For most deployments, we recommend to set at least the following variables: `LAKEKEEPER__PG_DATABASE_URL_READ`, `LAKEKEEPER__PG_DATABASE_URL_WRITE`, `LAKEKEEPER__PG_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.

## Routing and Base-URL

Some Lakekeeper endpoints return links pointing at Lakekeeper itself. By default, these links are generated using the `x-forwarded-host`, `x-forwarded-proto`, `x-forwarded-port` and `x-forwarded-prefix` headers, if these are not present, the `host` header is used. If this is not working for you, you may set the `LAKEKEEPER_BASE_URI` environment variable to the base-URL where Lakekeeper is externally reachable. This may be necessary if Lakekeeper runs behind a reverse proxy or load balancer, and you cannot set the headers accordingly. In general, we recommend relying on the headers. To respect the `host` header but not the `x-forwarded-` headers, set `LAKEKEEPER__USE_X_FORWARDED_HEADERS` to `false`.

### General

| Variable                                           | Example                                | Description |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__BASE_URI`</nobr>                | <nobr>`https://example.com:8181`<nobr> | Optional base-URL where the catalog is externally reachable. Default: `None`. See [Routing and Base-URL](#routing-and-base-url). |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__ENABLE_DEFAULT_PROJECT`<nobr>   | `true`                                 | If `true`, the NIL Project ID ("00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000") is used as a default if the user does not specify a project when connecting. This option is enabled by default, which we recommend for all single-project (single-tenant) setups. Default: `true`. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__RESERVED_NAMESPACES`                  | `system,examples,information_schema`   | Reserved Namespaces that cannot be created via the REST interface |
| `LAKEKEEPER__METRICS__PORT`                        | `9000`                                 | Port where the Prometheus metrics endpoint is reachable. Default: `9000` |
| `LAKEKEEPER__LISTEN_PORT`                          | `8181`                                 | Port Lakekeeper listens on. Default: `8181` |
| `LAKEKEEPER__BIND_IP`                              | `0.0.0.0`, `::1`, `::`                 | IP Address Lakekeeper binds to. Default: `0.0.0.0` (listen to all incoming IPv4 packages) |
| `LAKEKEEPER__SECRET_BACKEND`                       | `postgres`                             | The secret backend to use. If `kv2` (Hashicorp KV Version 2) is chosen, you need to provide [additional parameters](#vault-kv-version-2) Default: `postgres`, one-of: [`postgres`, `kv2`] |
| `LAKEKEEPER__SERVE_SWAGGER_UI`                     | `true`                                 | If `true`, Lakekeeper serves a swagger UI for management & catalog openAPI specs under `/swagger-ui` |
| `LAKEKEEPER__ALLOW_ORIGIN`                         | `*`                                    | A comma separated list of allowed origins for CORS. |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__USE_X_FORWARDED_HEADERS`</nobr> | <nobr>`false`<nobr>                    | If true, Lakekeeper respects the `x-forwarded-host`, `x-forwarded-proto`, `x-forwarded-port` and `x-forwarded-prefix` headers in incoming requests. This is mostly relevant for the `/config` endpoint. Default: `true` (Headers are respected.) |

### Pagination

Lakekeeper has default values for `default` and `max` page sizes of paginated queries. These are safeguards against malicious requests and the problems related to large page sizes described below.

The REST catalog [spec](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/404c8057275c9cfe204f2c7cc61114c128fbf759/open-api/rest-catalog-open-api.yaml#L2030-L2032) requires servers to return *all* results if `pageToken` is not set in the request. To obtain that behavior, set `LAKEKEEPER__PAGINATION_SIZE_MAX` to 4294967295, which corresponds to `u32::MAX`. Larger page sizes would lead to practical problems. Things to keep in mind:

- Retrieving huge numbers of rows is expensive, which might be exploited by malicious requests.
- Requests may time out or responses may exceed size limits for huge numbers of results.

| Variable                                          | Example            | Description |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__PAGINATION_SIZE_DEFAULT`<nobr> | <nobr>`1024`<nobr> | The default page size used for paginated queries. This value is used if the request's `pageToken` is set but empty. Default: `100` |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__PAGINATION_SIZE_MAX`<nobr>     | <nobr>`2048`<nobr> | The max page size used for paginated queries. This value is used if the request's `pageToken` is not set. Default: `1000` |

### Storage

| Variable                                                    | Example            | Description |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__ENABLE_AWS_SYSTEM_CREDENTIALS`<nobr>     | <nobr>`true`<nobr> | Lakekeeper supports using AWS system identities (i.e. through `AWS_*` environment variables or EC2 instance profiles) as storage credentials for warehouses. This feature is disabled by default to prevent accidental access to restricted storage locations. To enable AWS system identities, set `LAKEKEEPER__ENABLE_AWS_SYSTEM_CREDENTIALS` to `true`. Default: `false` (AWS system credentials disabled) |
| `LAKEKEEPER__S3_ENABLE_DIRECT_SYSTEM_CREDENTIALS`           | <nobr>`true`<nobr> | By default, when using AWS system credentials, users must specify an `assume-role-arn` for Lakekeeper to assume when accessing S3. Setting this option to `true` allows Lakekeeper to use system credentials directly without role assumption, meaning the system identity must have direct access to warehouse locations. Default: `false` (direct system credential access disabled) |
| `LAKEKEEPER__S3_REQUIRE_EXTERNAL_ID_FOR_SYSTEM_CREDENTIALS` | <nobr>`true`<nobr> | Controls whether an `external-id` is required when assuming a role with AWS system credentials. External IDs provide additional security when cross-account role assumption is used. Default: true (external ID required) |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__ENABLE_AZURE_SYSTEM_CREDENTIALS`<nobr>   | <nobr>`true`<nobr> | Lakekeeper supports using Azure system identities (i.e. through `AZURE_*` environment variables or VM managed identities) as storage credentials for warehouses. This feature is disabled by default to prevent accidental access to restricted storage locations. To enable Azure system identities, set `LAKEKEEPER__ENABLE_AZURE_SYSTEM_CREDENTIALS` to `true`. Default: `false` (Azure system credentials disabled) |
| `LAKEKEEPER__ENABLE_GCP_SYSTEM_CREDENTIALS`                 | <nobr>`true`<nobr> | Lakekeeper supports using GCP system identities (i.e. through `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variables or the Compute Engine Metadata Server) as storage credentials for warehouses. This feature is disabled by default to prevent accidental access to restricted storage locations. To enable GCP system identities, set `LAKEKEEPER__ENABLE_GCP_SYSTEM_CREDENTIALS` to `true`. Default: `false` (GCP system credentials disabled) |

### Persistence Store

Currently Lakekeeper supports only Postgres as a persistence store. You may either provide connection strings using `PG_DATABASE_URL_*` or use the `PG_*` environment variables. Connection strings take precedence. Postgres needs to be Version 15 or higher.

Lakekeeper supports configuring separate database URLs for read and write operations, allowing you to utilize read replicas for better scalability. By directing read queries to dedicated replicas via `LAKEKEEPER__PG_DATABASE_URL_READ`, you can significantly reduce load on your database primary (specified by `LAKEKEEPER__PG_DATABASE_URL_WRITE`), improving overall system performance as your deployment scales. This separation is particularly beneficial for read-heavy workloads. When using read replicas, be aware that replication lag may occur between the primary and replica databases depending on your Database setup. This means that immediately after a write operation, the changes might not be instantly visible when querying a read-only Lakekeeper endpoint (which uses the read replica). Consider this potential lag when designing applications that require immediate read-after-write consistency. For deployments where read-after-write consistency is critical, you can simply omit the `LAKEKEEPER__PG_DATABASE_URL_READ` setting, which will cause all operations to use the primary database connection.

| Variable                                               | Example                                               | Description |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----|
| `LAKEKEEPER__PG_DATABASE_URL_READ`                     | `postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/iceberg` | Postgres Database connection string used for reading. Defaults to `LAKEKEEPER__PG_DATABASE_URL_WRITE`. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__PG_DATABASE_URL_WRITE`                    | `postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/iceberg` | Postgres Database connection string used for writing. If `LAKEKEEPER__PG_DATABASE_URL_READ` is not specified, this connection is also used for reading. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__PG_ENCRYPTION_KEY`                        | `This is unsafe, please set a proper key`             | If `LAKEKEEPER__SECRET_BACKEND=postgres`, this key is used to encrypt secrets. It is required to change this for production deployments. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__PG_READ_POOL_CONNECTIONS`                 | `10`                                                  | Number of connections in the read pool |
| `LAKEKEEPER__PG_WRITE_POOL_CONNECTIONS`                | `5`                                                   | Number of connections in the write pool |
| `LAKEKEEPER__PG_HOST_R`                                | `localhost`                                           | Hostname for read operations. Defaults to `LAKEKEEPER__PG_HOST_W`. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__PG_HOST_W`                                | `localhost`                                           | Hostname for write operations |
| `LAKEKEEPER__PG_PORT`                                  | `5432`                                                | Port number |
| `LAKEKEEPER__PG_USER`                                  | `postgres`                                            | Username for authentication |
| `LAKEKEEPER__PG_PASSWORD`                              | `password`                                            | Password for authentication |
| `LAKEKEEPER__PG_DATABASE`                              | `iceberg`                                             | Database name |
| `LAKEKEEPER__PG_SCHEMA`                                | `lakekeeper`                                          | Schema holding Lakekeeper's tables. Unset by default, meaning `public`. See [Using a non-`public` Postgres schema](#using-a-non-public-postgres-schema). |
| `LAKEKEEPER__PG_SSL_MODE`                              | `require`                                             | SSL mode (disable, allow, prefer, require) |
| `LAKEKEEPER__PG_SSL_ROOT_CERT`                         | `/path/to/root/cert`                                  | Path to SSL root certificate |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__PG_ENABLE_STATEMENT_LOGGING`</nobr> | `true`                                                | Enable SQL statement logging |
| `LAKEKEEPER__PG_TEST_BEFORE_ACQUIRE`                   | `true`                                                | Test connections before acquiring from the pool |
| `LAKEKEEPER__PG_CONNECTION_MAX_LIFETIME`               | `1800`                                                | Maximum lifetime of connections in seconds |
| `LAKEKEEPER__PG_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT`                       | `10`                                                  | Timeout to acquire a new postgres connection in seconds. Default: `5` |

#### Required Postgres extensions

Lakekeeper migrations require the following extensions: `uuid-ossp`, `pgcrypto`, `pg_trgm`, `btree_gin`, `btree_gist`. They are part of the standard `postgresql-contrib` package and are pre-installed on most managed Postgres offerings (AWS RDS, Cloud SQL, Azure Database, etc.).

If the role Lakekeeper connects as has `CREATE` privilege on the database, the migrations will create the extensions automatically. Otherwise — for example, when running Lakekeeper as a low-privilege role (see below) — an administrator must pre-create them once per database:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "pgcrypto";
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "pg_trgm";
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "btree_gin";
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "btree_gist";
```

#### Using a non-`public` Postgres schema

Set `LAKEKEEPER__PG_SCHEMA=lakekeeper` to keep Lakekeeper's tables in a dedicated schema instead of `public`. Lakekeeper sets `search_path` to `"lakekeeper", public` on every connection, and `lakekeeper migrate` creates the schema when the role has `CREATE` on the database. Otherwise create it first: `CREATE SCHEMA lakekeeper AUTHORIZATION lakekeeper;`

`public` stays on the path so extension functions and operator classes installed there keep resolving. The schema name is quoted, so it is case-sensitive, and both the read and the write role need `USAGE` on it.

Create the [required extensions](#required-postgres-extensions) in `public` before the first migration. `CREATE EXTENSION` without a `SCHEMA` clause installs into the first entry of `search_path`, so they would land in the Lakekeeper schema. Another Lakekeeper in the same DB can't reach them, and dropping the schema drops them too. They're all relocatable, so an existing install can be fixed with `ALTER EXTENSION <name> SET SCHEMA public;`

Pointing an existing deployment at a new schema shows an empty catalog: the data stays where it is, so move it yourself with `ALTER TABLE ... SET SCHEMA` or a dump and restore.

Behind a connection pooler in transaction or statement pooling mode a session-level `search_path` is not kept. Leave `LAKEKEEPER__PG_SCHEMA` unset there and set it on the role instead, for both the read and the write role if they differ:

```sql
ALTER ROLE lakekeeper SET search_path = lakekeeper, public;
```

`lakekeeper migrate` refuses to run against the wrong schema, so a misconfigured `search_path` is caught before any data is written. If queries instead start failing with `relation ... does not exist` after a migration that succeeded, the pooler stopped applying the `search_path`: switch it to session pooling, or set the path on the role as above.

Do not set `search_path` through the `options` parameter of the connection URL. It has to be percent-encoded inside the URL, and poolers reject or ignore the parameter, so it fails silently.

### Vault KV Version 2

Configuration parameters if a Vault KV version 2 (i.e. Hashicorp Vault) compatible storage is used as a backend. Currently, we only support the `userpass` authentication method. Configuration may be passed as single values like `LAKEKEEPER__KV2__URL=http://vault.local` or as a compound value:
`LAKEKEEPER__KV2='{url="http://localhost:1234", user="test", password="test", secret_mount="secret"}'`

| Variable                                     | Example               | Description |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------|
| `LAKEKEEPER__KV2__URL`                       | `https://vault.local` | URL of the KV2 backend |
| `LAKEKEEPER__KV2__USER`                      | `admin`               | Username to authenticate against the KV2 backend |
| `LAKEKEEPER__KV2__PASSWORD`                  | `password`            | Password to authenticate against the KV2 backend |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__KV2__SECRET_MOUNT`</nobr> | `kv/data/iceberg`     | Path to the secret mount in the KV2 backend |


### Task Queues

Lakekeeper uses task queues internally to remove soft-deleted tabulars and purge tabular files. The following global configuration options are available:

| Variable                                                                          | Example    | Description |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-----|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__TASK_POLL_INTERVAL`</nobr>                                     | 3600ms/30s | Interval between polling for new tasks. Default: 10s. Supported units: ms (milliseconds) and s (seconds), leaving the unit out is deprecated, it'll default to seconds but is due to be removed in a future release. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__TASK_SOFT_DELETION_WORKERS`                                          | 2          | Number of workers spawned to finalize soft-deleted tables and views once their expiration elapses. The former name `LAKEKEEPER__TASK_TABULAR_EXPIRATION_WORKERS` is still accepted. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__TASK_TABULAR_PURGE_WORKERS`                                          | 2          | Number of workers spawned to purge table files after dropping a table with the purge option. |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__TASK_EXPIRE_SNAPSHOTS_WORKERS`</nobr><span class="lkp"></span> | 2          | Number of workers spawned that work on expire Snapshots tasks. See [Expire Snapshots Docs](./table-maintenance.md#expire-snapshots) for more information. |

### NATS

Lakekeeper can publish change events to NATS. The following configuration options are available:

| Variable                                   | Example                 | Description |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------|
| `LAKEKEEPER__NATS_ADDRESS`                 | `nats://localhost:4222` | The URL of the NATS server to connect to |
| `LAKEKEEPER__NATS_TOPIC`                   | `iceberg`               | The subject to publish events to |
| `LAKEKEEPER__NATS_USER`                    | `test-user`             | User to authenticate against NATS, needs `LAKEKEEPER__NATS_PASSWORD` |
| `LAKEKEEPER__NATS_PASSWORD`                | `test-password`         | Password to authenticate against nats, needs `LAKEKEEPER__NATS_USER` |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__NATS_CREDS_FILE`</nobr> | `/path/to/file.creds`   | Path to a file containing NATS credentials |
| `LAKEKEEPER__NATS_TOKEN`                   | `xyz`                   | NATS token to use for authentication |

### Kafka

Lakekeeper uses [rust-rdkafka](https://github.com/fede1024/rust-rdkafka) to enable publishing events to Kafka.

The following features of rust-rdkafka are enabled:

- tokio
- ztstd
- gssapi-vendored
- curl-static
- ssl-vendored
- libz-static

This means that all features of [librdkafka](https://github.com/confluentinc/librdkafka) are usable. All necessary dependencies are statically linked and cannot be disabled. If you want to use dynamic linking or disable a feature, you'll have to fork Lakekeeper and change the features accordingly. Please refer to the documentation of rust-rdkafka for details on how to enable dynamic linking or disable certain features.

To publish events to Kafka, set the following environment variables:

| Variable                                     | Example                                                                   | Description |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|
| `LAKEKEEPER__KAFKA_TOPIC`                    | `lakekeeper`                                                              | The topic to which events are published |
| `LAKEKEEPER__KAFKA_CONFIG`                   | `{"bootstrap.servers"="host1:port,host2:port","security.protocol"="SSL"}` | [librdkafka Configuration](https://github.com/confluentinc/librdkafka/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md) as "Dictionary". Note that you cannot use "JSON-Style-Syntax". Also see notes below |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__KAFKA_CONFIG_FILE`</nobr> | `/path/to/config_file`                                                    | [librdkafka Configuration](https://github.com/confluentinc/librdkafka/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md) to be loaded from a file. Also see notes below |

##### Notes

`LAKEKEEPER__KAFKA_CONFIG` and `LAKEKEEPER__KAFKA_CONFIG_FILE` are mutually exclusive and the values are not merged, if both variables are set. In case that both are set, `LAKEKEEPER__KAFKA_CONFIG` is used.

A `LAKEKEEPER__KAFKA_CONFIG_FILE` could look like this:

```
{
  "bootstrap.servers"="host1:port,host2:port",
  "security.protocol"="SASL_SSL",
  "sasl.mechanisms"="PLAIN",
}
```

Checking configuration parameters is deferred to `rdkafka`



### Logging Cloudevents

Cloudevents can also be logged, if you do not have Nats or Kafka up and running. This feature can be enabled by setting

`LAKEKEEPER__LOG_CLOUDEVENTS=true`

### Authentication

To prohibit unwanted access to data, we recommend to enable Authentication.

Authentication is enabled if:

* `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDER_URI` is set OR
* `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDERS` has at least one configured provider OR
* `LAKEKEEPER__ENABLE_KUBERNETES_AUTHENTICATION` is set to true

Lakekeeper Plus<span class="lkp"></span> refuses to start when no Authenticator is configured, so that a forgotten IdP configuration cannot silently expose the catalog to anonymous access. To run without Authentication — for example in local development — set `LAKEKEEPER__INSECURE_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED=true`. *Since Lakekeeper 0.14: deployments that previously ran Plus without Authentication must now set this variable to keep starting.*

In Lakekeeper multiple Authentication mechanisms can be enabled together, for example OpenID + Kubernetes. Lakekeeper builds an internal Authenticator chain of up to three identity providers. Incoming tokens need to be JWT tokens - Opaque tokens are not yet supported. Incoming tokens are introspected, and each Authentication provider checks if the given token can be handled by this provider. If it can be handled, the token is authenticated against this provider, otherwise the next Authenticator in the chain is checked.

The following Authenticators are available. Enabled Authenticators are checked in order:

1. **OpenID / OAuth2**<br>
   **Enabled if:** `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDER_URI` is set<br>
    **Validates Token with:** Locally with JWKS Keys fetched from the well-known configuration.<br>
   **Accepts JWT if** (both must be true):<br>
    - Issuer matches the issuer provided in the `.well-known/openid-configuration` of the `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDER_URI` OR issuer matches any of the `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_ADDITIONAL_ISSUERS`.<br>
    - If `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_AUDIENCE` is specified, any of the configured audiences must be present in the token<br>
1. **Kubernetes**<br>
   **Enabled if:** `LAKEKEEPER__ENABLE_KUBERNETES_AUTHENTICATION` is true<br>
   **Validates Token with:** Kubernetes `TokenReview` API
   **Accepts JWT if:**<br>
    - Token audience matches any of the audiences provided in `LAKEKEEPER__KUBERNETES_AUTHENTICATION_AUDIENCE`<br>
    - If `LAKEKEEPER__KUBERNETES_AUTHENTICATION_AUDIENCE` is not set, all tokens proceed to validation! We highly recommend to configure audiences, for most deployments `https://kubernetes.default.svc` works.<br>
1. **Kubernetes Legacy Tokens**<br>
   **Enabled if:** `LAKEKEEPER__ENABLE_KUBERNETES_AUTHENTICATION` is true and `LAKEKEEPER__KUBERNETES_AUTHENTICATION_ACCEPT_LEGACY_SERVICEACCOUNT` is true<br>
   **Validates Token with:** Kubernetes `TokenReview` API<br>
   **Accepts JWT if:**<br>
    - Tokens issuer is `kubernetes/serviceaccount` or `https://kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local`

If `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDER_URI` is specified, Lakekeeper will  verify access tokens against this provider. The provider must provide the `.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint and the openid-configuration needs to have `jwks_uri` and `issuer` defined.

Typical values for `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDER_URI` are:

* Keycloak: `https://keycloak.local/realms/{your-realm}`
* Entra-ID: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{your-tenant-id-here}/v2.0/`

Please check the [Authentication Guide](./authentication.md) for more details.

|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDER_URI`</nobr>                            | `https://keycloak.local/realms/{your-realm}` | OpenID Provider URL. Lakekeeper expects to find `<LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDER_URI>/.well-known/openid-configuration` and load JWKS tokens from there. Do not include the `/.well-known/openid-configuration` in the provided URL. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_AUDIENCE`                                             | `the-client-id-of-my-app`                    | Strongly recommended. If set, the token's `aud` claim must contain at least one of the configured audiences. Multiple audiences can be provided as a comma-separated list; a token is accepted if its `aud` matches any one of them (OR). If unset, audience validation is **skipped** — tokens for any audience are accepted as long as signature and issuer validate. Set this in production. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_ADDITIONAL_ISSUERS`                                   | `https://sts.windows.net/<Tenant>/`          | A comma separated list of additional issuers to trust. The issuer defined in the `issuer` field of the `.well-known/openid-configuration` is always trusted. `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_ADDITIONAL_ISSUERS` has no effect if `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDER_URI` is not set. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_SCOPE`                                                | `lakekeeper`                                 | Specify a scope that must be present in provided tokens received from the openid provider. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_SUBJECT_CLAIM`                                        | `sub` or `oid,sub`                           | Specify the claim(s) in the user's JWT used to identify a User. Accepts a single claim name or a comma-separated list of claim names; the first claim present in the token is used. By default Lakekeeper tries `oid` first, then falls back to `sub`. We strongly recommend setting this configuration explicitly in production deployments. Entra-ID users want to use `oid`; users from all other IdPs most likely want to use `sub`. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_ROLES_CLAIM`                                          | `resource_access.lakekeeper.roles`           | Specify the claim to use in provided JWT tokens to extract roles. The field should contain an array of strings or a single string. Supports nested claims using dot notation, e.g., "resource_access.account.roles". Used by authorizers that consume token roles, including Cedar and custom implementations. The default OpenFGA implementation does not use token roles. Requires a project ID to be set via the `x-project-id` header or `LAKEKEEPER__DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID`. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_DISPLAY_NAME_TEMPLATE`                                | `Service Account {email}`                    | Fallback display name for tokens that carry no name claim (typically machine / service-account tokens). Placeholders `{claim.path}` are substituted from the token's claims using dot notation; write a literal brace by doubling it (`{{`/`}}`). A real name claim always takes precedence; if a referenced claim is absent or not a string the template is skipped and the user keeps the `Nameless App with ID <user-id>` placeholder. A structurally malformed template (unbalanced or empty braces) aborts startup. Applies to the single-provider `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDER_URI` setup. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__ENABLE_KUBERNETES_AUTHENTICATION`                            | true                                         | If true, kubernetes service accounts can authenticate to Lakekeeper. This option is compatible with `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDER_URI` - multiple IdPs (OIDC and Kubernetes) can be enabled simultaneously. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__KUBERNETES_AUTHENTICATION_AUDIENCE`                          | `https://kubernetes.default.svc`             | Audiences that are expected in Kubernetes tokens. Only has an effect if `LAKEKEEPER__ENABLE_KUBERNETES_AUTHENTICATION` is true. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__KUBERNETES_AUTHENTICATION_ACCEPT_LEGACY_SERVICEACCOUNT` | `false`                                      | Add an authenticator that handles tokens with no audiences and the issuer set to `kubernetes/serviceaccount`. Only has an effect if `LAKEKEEPER__ENABLE_KUBERNETES_AUTHENTICATION` is true. |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__INSECURE_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED`</nobr><span class="lkp"></span> | `false`                                      | Lakekeeper Plus only. If `false` (default), the server refuses to start unless an Authenticator is configured, preventing accidental anonymous exposure of the catalog. Set to `true` to permit starting without Authentication (e.g. local development). |
| `LAKEKEEPER__KUBERNETES_AUTHENTICATION_SUBJECT_SOURCE`                    | `uid`                                        | Which `TokenReview` field becomes the user's subject in the user ID (`kubernetes~<subject>`). `uid` (default) uses the service account's Kubernetes UID, which differs per cluster. `username` uses `system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<name>`, which is stable across clusters and suitable for pre-provisioning users and roles. Changing this after users exist changes their IDs and orphans existing role assignments — choose it at initial setup. One-of: [`uid`, `username`]. |

#### Multiple OIDC Providers

For advanced scenarios requiring multiple OIDC providers (e.g., Okta for users + EKS OIDC for Kubernetes workloads), configure providers under `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDERS__<IDP_ID>__`. These providers are added in addition to `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDER_URI` (the primary provider, `idp_id = "oidc"`).

The `<IDP_ID>` key is the identity-provider ID used in user IDs like `<idp_id>~<subject>`. Each `<IDP_ID>` must match `[a-z0-9-]+` — lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens. Figment lowercases env var segments and uses `__` as a nesting separator, so `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDERS__MY-PROVIDER__URI=...` yields `idp_id = "my-provider"`; use a single `-` to separate words (a `__` in the IDP segment would create a nested key, not part of the name). `oidc` and `kubernetes` are reserved.

**Chain order.** Tokens are tried against authenticators in this order: the primary provider from `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDER_URI` (if set), then providers from `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDERS` in **alphabetical order of `idp_id`**, then Kubernetes (if enabled).

A token is routed to the **first** authenticator whose `iss` set contains the token's `iss` claim **and** whose `aud` set intersects the token's `aud` claim (an unset issuer or audience matches everything). Once routed, that authenticator performs full signature + issuer + audience validation; if validation fails the request is rejected — the chain does **not** fall through to the next link. As a consequence, if two providers' (issuer, audience) criteria overlap, the first chain link owns the overlap. Make `iss` × `aud` pairs disjoint across providers to avoid surprises.

**Provider Fields:**

| Variable suffix | Required | Example | Description |
|-----------------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `__URI` | Yes | `https://company.okta.com` | OIDC provider URI (must expose `.well-known/openid-configuration`). |
| `__AUDIENCE` | No (strongly recommended) | `lakekeeper,warehouse` | Expected audience(s) for tokens. If set, the token's `aud` must contain at least one of the configured audiences; provide multiple as a comma-separated list and a token is accepted if its `aud` matches any one of them (OR). If unset, audience validation is **skipped** — tokens for any audience are accepted as long as signature and issuer validate. Set this in production. |
| `__ADDITIONAL_ISSUERS` | No | `https://sts.windows.net/tenant/` | Additional issuers to trust (comma-separated). |
| `__SCOPE` | No | `lakekeeper` | Scope that must be present in tokens. |
| `__SUBJECT_CLAIMS` | No | `sub` or `oid,sub` | Claims to use as user ID (comma-separated, in order of preference). Defaults to `oid,sub`. |
| `__ROLES_CLAIM` | No | `resource_access.lakekeeper.roles` | Claim to use in provided JWT tokens to extract roles. |
| `__DISPLAY_NAME_TEMPLATE` | No | `Service Account {email}` | Fallback display name for this provider's tokens that carry no name claim. Same syntax and precedence as `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_DISPLAY_NAME_TEMPLATE` in the OpenID table above (dot-notation `{claim.path}` placeholders, `{{`/`}}` for literal braces, a real name claim wins, malformed templates abort startup). |
| `__REQUIRE_CONNECTED_ON_STARTUP` | No | `true` | When `true` (default), Lakekeeper refuses to start if this provider's OIDC/JWKS configuration cannot be loaded. Set to `false` to skip this provider while continuing startup. |

**Example: Okta + EKS OIDC**

```bash
LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDERS__OKTA__URI=https://company.okta.com
LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDERS__OKTA__AUDIENCE=https://company.okta.com
LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDERS__OKTA__SUBJECT_CLAIMS=sub
LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDERS__OKTA__ROLES_CLAIM=resource_access.lakekeeper.roles

LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDERS__EKSPROD__URI=https://oidc.eks.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/id/ABC123DEF456
LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDERS__EKSPROD__AUDIENCE=sts.amazonaws.com
LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDERS__EKSPROD__SUBJECT_CLAIMS=sub
LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDERS__EKSPROD__REQUIRE_CONNECTED_ON_STARTUP=false
```

!!! note
    Providers fail startup by default if their OIDC endpoint cannot be loaded. Set `REQUIRE_CONNECTED_ON_STARTUP=false` for providers that should be skipped while Lakekeeper continues starting.

### Authorization
Authorization is only effective if [Authentication](#authentication) is enabled.

We strongly recommend bootstrapping new deployments with authorization already enabled. Switching the configured `AUTHZ_BACKEND` after bootstrap is supported when moving to (or replacing the OpenFGA store behind) the OpenFGA backend — see [Switching to OpenFGA](./authorization-openfga.md#switching-to-openfga-or-replacing-the-store) for the procedure and its limitations (structural hierarchy is rebuilt from the catalog; ownership, grants, and role assignments are not). For other backends, create a new Lakekeeper instance and migrate your tables.

| Variable                                 | Example                                                              | Description          |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__AUTHZ_BACKEND`</nobr> | `allowall`                                                           | The authorization backend to use. External deployments can select `openfga`, `cedar`, or `verglas`. The `allowall` backend disables authorization. |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__INSTANCE_ADMINS`</nobr> | `["kubernetes~eb952f26-3a1a-4020-bcb4-3f7d43049284","oidc~alice"]` | TOML inline array of user IDs (`<idp_id>~<subject>`) that are granted instance-admin privileges via deployment config. For Kubernetes the subject is the service account's `uid`. Even a single admin must be wrapped in brackets. See [Instance Admins](./authorization.md#instance-admins) for scope and rationale. Default: `[]`. |

##### OpenFGA
| Variable                                                 | Example                                                                    | Description |

If `LAKEKEEPER__OPENFGA__CLIENT_ID` is set, the API Key is ignored. If neither API Key nor Client ID is specified, no authentication is used. |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__OPENFGA__CLIENT_ID`</nobr>            | `12345`                                                                    | The Client ID to use for Authenticating if OpenFGA is secured via [OIDC](https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/setup-openfga/configure-openfga#oidc). |
| `LAKEKEEPER__OPENFGA__CLIENT_SECRET`                     | `abcd`                                                                     | Client Secret for the Client ID. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__OPENFGA__TOKEN_ENDPOINT`                    | `https://keycloak.example.com/realms/master/protocol/openid-connect/token` | Token Endpoint to use when exchanging client credentials for an access token for OpenFGA. Required if Client ID is set |
| `LAKEKEEPER__OPENFGA__SCOPE`                             | `openfga`                                                                  | Additional scopes to request in the Client Credential flow. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__OPENFGA__AUTHORIZATION_MODEL_PREFIX`        | `collaboration`                                                            | Explicitly set the Authorization model prefix. Defaults to `collaboration` if not set. We recommend to use this setting only in combination with `LAKEKEEPER__OPENFGA__AUTHORIZATION_MODEL_PREFIX`. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__OPENFGA__AUTHORIZATION_MODEL_VERSION`       | `3.1`                                                                      | Version of the model to use. If specified, the specified model version must already exist. This can be used to roll-back to previously applied model versions or to connect to externally managed models. Migration is disabled if the model version is set. Version should have the format <major>.<minor>. |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__OPENFGA__MAX_BATCH_CHECK_SIZE`</nobr> | `50`                                                                       | p The maximum number of checks than can be handled by a batch check request. This is a [configuration option](https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/setup-openfga/configuration#OPENFGA_MAX_CHECKS_PER_BATCH_CHECK) of the `OpenFGA` server with default value 50. |

##### Verglas

| Variable | Example | Description |

| `LAKEKEEPER__VERGLAS__ENDPOINT` | `http://verglas-access:8345/` | Base URL for the tenant-local Verglas access service. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__VERGLAS__WORKLOAD_CREDENTIAL_FILE` | `/run/secrets/verglas-policy-engine-token` | Read-only file containing a short-lived `policy-engine` workload token. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__VERGLAS__TENANT_ID` | `tenant-123` | Verglas tenant that contains the databases served by this catalog. |

##### Cedar <span class="lkp"></span>

Please check the [Authorization User Guide](./authorization-cedar.md#authorization-with-cedar) for more information on Cedar.

| Variable                                               | Example                                                 | Description |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----|
| `LAKEKEEPER__CEDAR__POLICY_SOURCES__LOCAL_FILES`       | `[/path/to/policies1.cedar,/path/to/policies2.cedar]`   | List of local file paths containing Cedar policies in Cedar format (not JSON). |
| `LAKEKEEPER__CEDAR__ENTITY_JSON_SOURCES__LOCAL_FILES`  | `[/path/to/entities1.json,/path/to/entities2.json]`     | List of local JSON file paths containing additional Cedar entities (typically roles). |
| `LAKEKEEPER__CEDAR__POLICY_SOURCES__K8S_CM`            | `[my-cm-1, my-cm-2]`                                    | List of Kubernetes ConfigMap names in the same namespace as Lakekeeper. Every key ending with `.cedar` is treated as a policy source in Cedar format (not JSON). |
| `LAKEKEEPER__CEDAR__ENTITY_JSON_SOURCES__K8S_CM`       | `[my-cm-1, my-cm-2]`                                    | List of Kubernetes ConfigMap names in the same namespace as Lakekeeper. Every key ending with `.cedarentities.json` is treated as an entity source. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__CEDAR__REFRESH_INTERVAL_SECS`             | `5`                                                     | Refresh interval in seconds for reloading policies and entities from Kubernetes ConfigMaps and local files. Default: `5` seconds. See [Cedar Authorization](./authorization-cedar.md#authorization-with-cedar) for more information. |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__CEDAR__REFRESH_DISABLED`</nobr>     | `false`                                                 | When set to `true`, disables periodic reloading of policies and entities entirely. Useful in environments where Cedar configuration is known to be static and the polling overhead is undesirable. Default: `false`. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__CEDAR__EXTERNALLY_MANAGED_USER_AND_ROLES` | `false`                                                 | When set to `true`, Lakekeeper expects all roles and users to be managed externally via entities.json and does not extract `Lakekeeper::Role` or `Lakekeeper::User` entities from the user's token. When set to `false` (default), Lakekeeper automatically provides `Lakekeeper::Role` and `Lakekeeper::User` entities to Cedar based on information extracted from the user's token. When set to `false`, ensure `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_ROLES_CLAIM` is configured to specify which claim in the token contains role information. |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__CEDAR__SCHEMA_FILE`</nobr>          | `/path/to/custom/schema.cedarschema`                    | Path to a custom Cedar schema file that replaces the embedded default schema entirely. Use this only when you need complete control over the schema definition. Your custom schema must maintain compatibility with all Lakekeeper-provided entities (Server, Project, Warehouse, Namespace, Table, View, and optionally User & Role). For most use cases, prefer `LAKEKEEPER__CEDAR__SCHEMA_FRAGMENT_FILE` to extend the built-in schema. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__CEDAR__SCHEMA_FRAGMENT_FILE`              | `/path/to/schema-fragment.cedarschema`                  | Path to a Cedar schema fragment file that extends the embedded default schema. This is the recommended approach for adding custom entity types or grouped actions while preserving compatibility with Lakekeeper's built-in schema. The fragment is merged with the default schema at startup. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__CEDAR__PROPERTY_PARSE_PREFIXES`           | `["access_", "access-"]`                                | List of property key prefixes that trigger entity-reference parsing for ABAC. Table, Namespace, and View properties whose key starts with one of these prefixes are parsed as JSON arrays of `role:` / `role-full:` / `user:` references. Parsed values are exposed in Cedar as `roles: Set<Role>` and `users: Set<User>` on each `ResourcePropertyValue`. Set to `[]` to disable parsing entirely. Default: `["access_", "access-"]`. See [Property-Based Access Control](./authorization-cedar.md#property-based-access-control). |
| `LAKEKEEPER__CEDAR__GLOBAL_ROLE_IDS_ENABLED`           | `false`                                                 | When `true`, the `global_role_ids: Set<String>` attribute on every `Lakekeeper::User` entity is populated with the `source_id` of every provider-resolved role (token claims, LDAP, etc.). This enables simpler policies such as `principal.global_role_ids.contains("admins")` without needing to specify a `provider_id`. Only meaningful when all configured role providers use globally unique `source_id` values (i.e. no two providers assign the same `source_id` to different roles). When `false` (default), `global_role_ids` is always an empty set. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__CEDAR__USER_DERIVATIONS__<NAME>__SOURCE`  | `source_id`                                             | Source field for a user identity derivation rule. Supported values: `source_id` (the user's subject in the IdP) or `provider_id` (e.g. `oidc`, `kubernetes`). `<NAME>` is a human-readable key (e.g. `EMAIL_PARTS`) used in error messages. See [User Identity Derivations](./authorization-cedar.md#user-identity-derivations). |
| `LAKEKEEPER__CEDAR__USER_DERIVATIONS__<NAME>__PATTERN` | <nobr>`^(?<username>[^@]+)`<br>`@(?<domain>.+)$`</nobr> | Regex pattern with named capture groups for a user identity derivation rule. Each named group that matches a non-empty substring becomes a string tag on the `UserDerivedAttributes` entity, accessible in policies via `principal.derived_attributes.hasTag("…")` / `principal.derived_attributes.getTag("…")`. Invalid patterns cause a startup error. See [User Identity Derivations](./authorization-cedar.md#user-identity-derivations). |
| `LAKEKEEPER__CEDAR__USER_DERIVATIONS__<NAME>__TRANSFORM` | `lowercase` | Optional transformation applied to all captured values before they become Cedar tags. Supported values: `none` (default — keep as-is), `lowercase`, `uppercase`. Because Cedar string comparison is case-sensitive, use `lowercase` to normalize captured values so policies can compare against a known-case literal (e.g. `getTag("domain") == "example.com"`). If different capture groups need different transforms, use separate derivation entries with distinct regexes. See [User Identity Derivations](./authorization-cedar.md#user-identity-derivations). |

| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__CEDAR__DEBUG__LOG_ENTITIES`</nobr> | `false` | If `true`, logs all internal entities (excluding externally managed entities) for each authorization request at debug level. This is useful for debugging authorization issues but can be verbose and impacts performance. Logging only occurs when both this flag is `true` AND debug logging is enabled (`RUST_LOG=debug`). Default: `false`. |


### UI

When using the built-in UI which is hosted as part of the Lakekeeper binary, most values are pre-set with the corresponding values of Lakekeeper itself. Customization is typically required if Authentication is enabled. Please check the [Authentication guide](./authentication.md) for more information.

| Variable                                           | Example                                      | Description |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__UI__OPENID_PROVIDER_URI`</nobr> | `https://keycloak.local/realms/{your-realm}` | OpenID provider URI used for login in the UI. Defaults to `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_PROVIDER_URI`. Set this only if the IdP is reachable under a different URI from the users browser and lakekeeper. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__UI__OPENID_CLIENT_ID`                 | `lakekeeper-ui`                              | Client ID to use for the Authorization Code Flow of the UI. Required if Authentication is enabled. Defaults to `lakekeeper` |
| `LAKEKEEPER__UI__OPENID_REDIRECT_PATH`             | `/callback`                                  | Path where the UI receives the callback including the tokens from the users browser. Defaults to: `/callback` |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__UI__OPENID_SCOPE`</nobr>        | `openid email`                               | Scopes to request from the IdP. Defaults to `openid profile email`. |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__UI__OPENID_RESOURCE`</nobr>     | `lakekeeper-api`                             | Resources to request from the IdP. If not specified, the `resource` field is omitted (default). |
| `LAKEKEEPER__UI__OPENID_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_PATH` | `/logout`                                    | Path the UI calls when users are logged out from the IdP. Defaults to `/logout` |
| `LAKEKEEPER__UI__OPENID_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL`  | `https://portal.cloud.example/login`         | Absolute URL sent as `post_logout_redirect_uri` on logout, overriding the value derived from `LAKEKEEPER__UI__OPENID_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_PATH`. Use for IdPs that only allow pre-registered post-logout URLs (e.g. a cloud portal's own login page). If unset, the redirect is derived from the logout path. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__UI__OPENID_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_DISABLED` | `false`                                  | If `true`, the UI omits the `post_logout_redirect_uri` parameter entirely on logout (it is optional per the OIDC RFC). Use for IdPs that reject any non-registered post-logout URL. Defaults to `false`. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__UI__LAKEKEEPER_URL`                   | `https://example.com/lakekeeper`             | URI where the users browser can reach Lakekeeper. Defaults to the value of `LAKEKEEPER__BASE_URI`. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__UI__OPENID_TOKEN_TYPE`                | `access_token`                               | The token type to use for authenticating to Lakekeeper. The default value `access_token` works for most IdPs. Some IdPs, such as the Google Identity Platform, recommend the use of the OIDC ID Token instead. To use the ID token instead of the access token for Authentication, specify a value of `id_token`. Possible values are `access_token` and `id_token`. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__UI__ENABLE_SURVEYS`              | `true`                                       | The UI occasionally shows in-app user surveys to gather feedback on Lakekeeper. All responses are collected anonymously. Set to `false` to opt out; the UI then never initializes the survey SDK and makes no third-party requests. Defaults to `true`. |
| `LAKEKEEPER__UI__BRANDING`<span class="lkp"></span> | `eyJ0aGVtZXMiOns...`                | Base64-encoded JSON that white-labels the UI with custom theme colors and partner logos. See [UI Branding](./ui-branding.md). Lakekeeper Plus only. |

### Caching
Lakekeeper uses in-memory caches to speed up certain operations.

Most cache entries' time-to-live is jittered downward by a small random fraction (up to 10%), so an entry lives 90–100% of the configured TTL. This desynchronizes expiry across replicas that warmed the same key at the same time, preventing a fleet-wide refresh stampede on the TTL boundary. The configured `..._TIME_TO_LIVE_SECS` remains the upper bound — jitter only ever shortens an entry's life, never extends it.

**Short-Term Credentials (STC) Cache**

When Lakekeeper vends short-term credentials for cloud storage access (S3 STS, Azure SAS tokens, or GCP access tokens), these credentials can be cached to reduce load on cloud identity services and improve response times.

| Variable                                        | Example | Description      |
|-------------------------------------------------|---------|------------------|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__CACHE__STC__ENABLED`</nobr>  | `true`  | Enable or disable the short-term credentials cache. Default: `true` |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__CACHE__STC__CAPACITY`</nobr> | `10000` | Maximum number of credential entries to cache, **per cloud provider** — S3, Azure, and GCP each maintain a separate cache. A single-cloud deployment caches at most this many entries; a server vending for multiple clouds can hold up to this many per provider in use. Default: `10000` |

*Expiry Mechanism*: Cached credentials automatically expire based on the validity period of the underlying cloud credentials. Lakekeeper caches credentials for half their lifetime (e.g., if GCP STS returns credentials valid for 1 hour, they're cached for 30 minutes) with a maximum cache duration of 1 hour. This ensures credentials remain fresh while reducing unnecessary identity service calls.

*Metrics*: The STC cache exposes Prometheus metrics for monitoring:

- `lakekeeper_cache_size{cache_type="stc"}`: Current number of entries in the cache
- `lakekeeper_cache_hits_total{cache_type="stc"}`: Total number of cache hits
- `lakekeeper_cache_misses_total{cache_type="stc"}`: Total number of cache misses

**Warehouse Cache**

Caches warehouse metadata to reduce database queries for warehouse lookups.

| Configuration Key                                             | Type    | Default | Description |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|-----|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__CACHE__WAREHOUSE__ENABLED`<nobr>           | boolean | `true`  | Enable/disable warehouse caching. Default: `true` |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__CACHE__WAREHOUSE__CAPACITY`<nobr>          | integer | `1000`  | Maximum number of warehouses to cache. Default: `1000` |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__CACHE__WAREHOUSE__TIME_TO_LIVE_SECS`<nobr> | integer | `60`    | Time-to-live for cache entries in seconds. Default: `60` |

If the cache is enabled, changes to Storage Profile may take up to the configured TTL (default: 60 seconds) to be reflected in all Lakekeeper workers. If a single worker is used, the Cache is always up to date. Warehouse metadata is guaranteed to be fresh for load table & view operations also for multi-worker deployments.

*Metrics*: The Warehouse cache exposes Prometheus metrics for monitoring:

- `lakekeeper_cache_size{cache_type="warehouse"}`: Current number of entries in the cache
- `lakekeeper_cache_hits_total{cache_type="warehouse"}`: Total number of cache hits
- `lakekeeper_cache_misses_total{cache_type="warehouse"}`: Total number of cache misses

**Namespace Cache**

Caches namespace metadata and hierarchies to reduce database queries for namespace lookups. Namespace lookups are also required for table & view operations.

| Configuration Key                                             | Type    | Default | Description |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|-----|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__CACHE__NAMESPACE__ENABLED`<nobr>           | boolean | `true`  | Enable/disable namespace caching. Default: `true` |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__CACHE__NAMESPACE__CAPACITY`<nobr>          | integer | `1000`  | Maximum number of namespaces to cache. Default: `1000` |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__CACHE__NAMESPACE__TIME_TO_LIVE_SECS`<nobr> | integer | `60`    | Time-to-live for cache entries in seconds. Default: `60` |

If the cache is enabled, changes to namespace properties may take up to the configured TTL (default: 60 seconds) to be reflected in all Lakekeeper workers. If a single worker is used, the Cache is always up to date. The namespace cache stores both individual namespaces and their parent hierarchies for efficient lookups.

*Metrics*: The Namespace cache exposes Prometheus metrics for monitoring:

- `lakekeeper_cache_size{cache_type="namespace"}`: Current number of entries in the cache
- `lakekeeper_cache_hits_total{cache_type="namespace"}`: Total number of cache hits
- `lakekeeper_cache_misses_total{cache_type="namespace"}`: Total number of cache misses

**Secrets Cache**

Caches storage secrets to reduce load on the secret store. Since Lakekeeper never updates secrets, long TTLs can significantly increase resilience against secret store outages, especially when the secret store is external to the main database backend.

| Configuration Key                                           | Type    | Default | Description |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|-----|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__CACHE__SECRETS__ENABLED`<nobr>           | boolean | `true`  | Enable/disable secrets caching. Default: `true` |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__CACHE__SECRETS__CAPACITY`<nobr>          | integer | `500`   | Maximum number of secrets to cache. Default: `500` |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__CACHE__SECRETS__TIME_TO_LIVE_SECS`<nobr> | integer | `600`   | Time-to-live for cache entries in seconds. Default: `600` (10 minutes) |

*Metrics*: The Secrets cache exposes Prometheus metrics for monitoring:

- `lakekeeper_cache_size{cache_type="secrets"}`: Current number of entries in the cache
- `lakekeeper_cache_hits_total{cache_type="secrets"}`: Total number of cache hits
- `lakekeeper_cache_misses_total{cache_type="secrets"}`: Total number of cache misses

**Role Cache**

Caches role metadata to reduce database queries for role lookups. The role cache uses a two-tier caching mechanism: a primary cache indexed by role ID and a secondary index by project ID and role identifier, enabling efficient lookups from both identifiers. Note that this cache only stores role definitions and does not include any information about role assignments to users or principals.

| Configuration Key                                        | Type    | Default | Description |
|----------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|-----|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__CACHE__ROLE__ENABLED`<nobr>           | boolean | `true`  | Enable/disable role caching. Default: `true` |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__CACHE__ROLE__CAPACITY`<nobr>          | integer | `10000` | Maximum number of roles to cache. Default: `10000` |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__CACHE__ROLE__TIME_TO_LIVE_SECS`<nobr> | integer | `120`   | Time-to-live for cache entries in seconds. Default: `120` (2 minutes) |

If the cache is enabled, changes to role metadata may take up to the configured TTL (default: 120 seconds) to be reflected in all Lakekeeper workers. If a single worker is used, the cache is always up to date. The cache is automatically invalidated when roles are updated or deleted.

*Metrics*: The Role cache exposes Prometheus metrics for monitoring:

- `lakekeeper_cache_size{cache_type="role"}`: Current number of entries in the cache
- `lakekeeper_cache_hits_total{cache_type="role"}`: Total number of cache hits
- `lakekeeper_cache_misses_total{cache_type="role"}`: Total number of cache misses

**User Assignments Cache**

Caches the set of roles assigned to each user (`UserId → role assignments`). This is the hot-path cache checked on every authorization request and is also the in-memory layer used by the LDAP role provider's two-layer caching scheme. The TTL must not exceed `LAKEKEEPER__CACHE__ROLE__TIME_TO_LIVE_SECS` to bound the window in which a deleted role can still appear in assignment results.

| Configuration Key                                                    | Type    | Default | Description |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|-----|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__CACHE__USER_ASSIGNMENTS__ENABLED`<nobr>           | boolean | `true`  | Enable/disable user-assignments caching. Default: `true` |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__CACHE__USER_ASSIGNMENTS__CAPACITY`<nobr>          | integer | `50000` | Maximum number of users whose assignments are held in memory. Default: `50000` |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__CACHE__USER_ASSIGNMENTS__TIME_TO_LIVE_SECS`<nobr> | integer | `120`   | Time-to-live for cache entries in seconds. Must not exceed `LAKEKEEPER__CACHE__ROLE__TIME_TO_LIVE_SECS`. Default: `120` (2 minutes) |

*Metrics*: The User Assignments cache exposes Prometheus metrics for monitoring:

- `lakekeeper_cache_size{cache_type="user_assignments"}`: Current number of entries in the cache
- `lakekeeper_cache_hits_total{cache_type="user_assignments"}`: Total number of cache hits
- `lakekeeper_cache_misses_total{cache_type="user_assignments"}`: Total number of cache misses

**Role Members Cache**

Caches the members of each role (`RoleId → role members`). This is a cold-path cache populated only by admin/provider queries that list a role's members. Each entry holds a role's full member list, so the default capacity is deliberately low.

| Configuration Key                                                | Type    | Default | Description |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|-----|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__CACHE__ROLE_MEMBERS__ENABLED`<nobr>           | boolean | `true`  | Enable/disable role-members caching. Default: `true` |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__CACHE__ROLE_MEMBERS__CAPACITY`<nobr>          | integer | `1000`  | Maximum number of roles whose member lists are held in memory. Default: `1000` |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__CACHE__ROLE_MEMBERS__TIME_TO_LIVE_SECS`<nobr> | integer | `120`   | Time-to-live for cache entries in seconds. Default: `120` (2 minutes) |

*Metrics*: The Role Members cache exposes Prometheus metrics for monitoring:

- `lakekeeper_cache_size{cache_type="role_members"}`: Current number of entries in the cache
- `lakekeeper_cache_hits_total{cache_type="role_members"}`: Total number of cache hits
- `lakekeeper_cache_misses_total{cache_type="role_members"}`: Total number of cache misses

### Endpoint Statistics

Lakekeeper collects statistics about the usage of its endpoints. Every Lakekeeper instance accumulates endpoint calls for a certain duration in memory before writing them into the database. The following configuration options are available:

| Variable                                               | Example | Description |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__ENDPOINT_STAT_FLUSH_INTERVAL`<nobr> | 30s     | Interval in seconds to write endpoint statistics into the database. Default: 30s, valid units are (s\|ms) |

### SSL Dependencies

Lakekeeper validates outbound TLS connections against two root stores combined:

- **Mozilla root CAs** bundled into the binary via `webpki-roots` / `webpki-root-certs`. Public endpoints (AWS, GCS, Azure, OIDC providers) work out of the box, including on minimal images with no system CA bundle (scratch, `distroless`, `ubi-micro`).
- **System / custom CAs** loaded via `rustls-native-certs`, which respects `SSL_CERT_FILE` and `SSL_CERT_DIR`. Point these at a PEM bundle or directory to trust self-signed certificates (e.g. for MinIO, internal IdPs). When unset, the standard host paths are consulted (`/etc/ssl/certs/...`, `/etc/pki/tls/certs/...`, etc.).

The certificate presented by an endpoint cannot itself be a CA — it must be an end-entity certificate, otherwise TLS handshakes fail with `CaUsedAsEndEntity`.

Two code paths do *not* use the bundled webpki roots and therefore require a system CA bundle at `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` (or one of the other standard locations):

- **Vault** integration (via `vaultrs` → `rustls-platform-verifier`). You can also pass a PEM bundle explicitly through the Vault client configuration.
- **Kafka** integration (via `librdkafka` / OpenSSL).

The official `distroless` and `ubi` images ship a CA bundle, so these work without extra configuration. If you roll your own minimal image and use Vault or Kafka, install `ca-certificates` or copy a bundle to `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`.

### Request Limits

Lakekeeper allows you to configure limits on incoming requests to protect against resource exhaustion and denial-of-service attacks.

| Variable                                         | Example   | Description   |
|--------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------------|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__MAX_REQUEST_BODY_SIZE`</nobr> | `2097152` | Maximum request body size in bytes. Default: `2097152` (2 MB) |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__MAX_REQUEST_TIME`</nobr>      | `30s`     | Maximum time allowed for a request to complete. Accepts format `{number}{ms\|s}`. Default: `30s` |

### Roles

Limits applied to the role model.

`LAKEKEEPER__ROLE__MAX_NESTING_DEPTH` bounds how deeply roles may be nested in one another (role→role membership). The depth is the number of role→role edges in a chain; direct user assignments do not count. Adding a membership edge that would make any chain longer than this limit is rejected with `RoleMembershipDepthExceeded` (HTTP 409).

This bound is enforced on the catalog (Postgres) write path. When using the OpenFGA authorization backend, nesting depth is governed by OpenFGA's own resolution limits rather than this setting — the same asymmetry as role-membership cycle prevention.

| Variable                                            | Example | Description |
|-----------------------------------------------------|---------|-------------|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__ROLE__MAX_NESTING_DEPTH`</nobr>  | `10`    | Maximum number of role→role edges in any nesting chain. Default: `10` |

### Maintenance Mode

Captured at startup; not dynamic. While `read-only`:

- Mutating requests (anything other than `GET`/`HEAD`/`OPTIONS`) on `/catalog/v1` and `/management/v1` return `503` with `Retry-After: 60` and `error.type = "MaintenanceModeError"`. `/health` is unaffected.
- Built-in task queue workers are not started.
- `GET /v1/config` skips user auto-registration.
- `GET /health` exposes the current mode as `maintenance_mode` for operator fan-out checks.

| Variable                                       | Example     | Description |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__MAINTENANCE_MODE`</nobr>    | `read-only` | `off` (default) or `read-only`. Captured at startup; not dynamic. |

### Idempotency

Lakekeeper supports the [Iceberg REST Catalog Idempotency](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/main/open-api/rest-catalog-open-api.yaml) specification. When enabled, clients can send an `Idempotency-Key` header on mutation requests to guarantee at-most-once execution. The server advertises support via the `idempotency-key-lifetime` field in the `GET /v1/config` response.

| Variable | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__IDEMPOTENCY__ENABLED`</nobr> | `true` | Enable idempotency key support. When enabled, `idempotency-key-lifetime` is advertised in `getConfig`. Default: `true` |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__IDEMPOTENCY__LIFETIME`</nobr> | `PT30M` | How long idempotency records are kept, in ISO-8601 duration format. This value is advertised to clients. Default: `PT30M` (30 minutes) |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__IDEMPOTENCY__GRACE_PERIOD`</nobr> | `PT5M` | Grace period added on top of lifetime for clock skew and transit delays, in ISO-8601 duration format. Default: `PT5M` (5 minutes) |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__IDEMPOTENCY__CLEANUP_TIMEOUT`</nobr> | `PT30S` | Maximum time a background cleanup task may run before being considered dead. If exceeded, the next attempt takes over. Default: `PT30S` (30 seconds) |

### Audit Logging

Lakekeeper can generate detailed audit logs for all authorization events. Audit logs are written to the standard logging output and can be filtered by the `event_source = "audit"` field. For more information, see the [Logging Guide](./logging.md).

| Variable                                           | Example | Description   |
|----------------------------------------------------|---------|---------------|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__AUDIT__TRACING__ENABLED`</nobr> | `true`  | Enable audit logging for authorization events. When enabled, all authorization checks (both successful and failed) are logged at the `INFO` level with `event_source = "audit"`. Audit logs include the actor, action, resource, and outcome. Default: `false` |

### Trusted Engines

Trusted engines enable Lakekeeper to make context-aware authorization decisions for views with delegated execution (DEFINER security model). When configured, Lakekeeper:

1. **Protects the owner property** — only requests from a matched engine can set or remove the view property that controls delegated execution (e.g. `trino.run-as-owner`).
2. **Evaluates `referenced-by` chains** — when a trusted engine sends the `referenced-by` query parameter on `loadTable` / `loadView`, Lakekeeper resolves the full view chain and checks permissions for the correct user at each step.

For a detailed explanation of DEFINER vs INVOKER views, see the [View Security](./view-security.md) guide.

Trusted engines are configured as a map under `LAKEKEEPER__TRUSTED_ENGINES`. Each entry has a logical name (the map key), a type, the owner property name, and one or more identities that define which tokens are trusted.

#### Configuration

| Variable | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| <code>LAKEKEEPER__TRUSTED_ENGINES__<wbr>&lt;NAME&gt;__TYPE</code> | `trino` | Engine type. Currently only `trino` is supported. |
| <code>LAKEKEEPER__TRUSTED_ENGINES__<wbr>&lt;NAME&gt;__OWNER_PROPERTY</code> | `trino.run-as-owner` | The view property that identifies the owner for delegated execution. |

Each engine requires one or more **identities** — keyed by Identity Provider ID (e.g. `oidc`, `kubernetes` as configured in [Authentication](./authentication.md)) — that define which tokens are trusted. A token matches an identity if the Identity Provider ID matches AND (any audience matches OR any subject matches). Multiple engines can match a single token. List values use bracket syntax: `[value1, value2]` — even for a single value: `[value]`.

| Variable | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__TRUSTED_ENGINES__<NAME>__`</nobr><br><nobr>`IDENTITIES__<IDP_ID>__AUDIENCES`</nobr> | `[trino_dev, trino_prod]` | List of JWT audiences. A token matches if any of its audiences appears in this list. |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__TRUSTED_ENGINES__<NAME>__`</nobr><br><nobr>`IDENTITIES__<IDP_ID>__SUBJECTS`</nobr> | `[trino-sa]` | List of JWT subjects. A token matches if its subject appears in this list. Useful for service accounts. |

**Example:** Trust a Trino engine whose tokens come from the `oidc` provider with audience `trino`:

```bash
LAKEKEEPER__TRUSTED_ENGINES__TRINO__TYPE=trino
LAKEKEEPER__TRUSTED_ENGINES__TRINO__OWNER_PROPERTY=trino.run-as-owner
LAKEKEEPER__TRUSTED_ENGINES__TRINO__IDENTITIES__OIDC__AUDIENCES=[trino]
```

**Example with multiple IdPs:** Trust Trino from both an OIDC provider and a Kubernetes service account:

```bash
LAKEKEEPER__TRUSTED_ENGINES__TRINO__TYPE=trino
LAKEKEEPER__TRUSTED_ENGINES__TRINO__OWNER_PROPERTY=trino.run-as-owner
LAKEKEEPER__TRUSTED_ENGINES__TRINO__IDENTITIES__OIDC__AUDIENCES=[trino_dev, trino_prod]
LAKEKEEPER__TRUSTED_ENGINES__TRINO__IDENTITIES__KUBERNETES__SUBJECTS=[trino-sa]
```

### Role Provider <span class="lkp"></span>

Authorizers such as `Cedar` support pluggable role providers that resolve a user's group memberships from an external directory (e.g. LDAP / Active Directory). Multiple providers can be configured in parallel, each with a unique identifier. `OpenFGA` does not use role providers — roles are stored directly in OpenFGA.

Role providers that resolve groups over HTTPS — the Microsoft Graph (Entra ID) provider — honor the standard `HTTPS_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` environment variables for outbound requests. There is no per-provider proxy setting.

##### Chain settings

| Variable                                                             | Default | Description |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER_CHAIN__LOG_UNHANDLED_USERS`</nobr>  | `true`  | When `true`, an audit event is emitted whenever a user is not matched by any configured role provider. Useful for detecting misconfigured domain filters. Set to `false` to suppress these events for deployments where some users are intentionally not covered by any provider. |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER_CHAIN__LOG_ROLE_ASSIGNMENTS`</nobr> | `false` | When `true`, an audit event listing every resolved role name is emitted after each successful role resolution. Very noisy — intended for debugging role-provider configuration only. See [Logging — Operational Audit Events](./logging.md) for the event schema. |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER_CHAIN__PERSIST_TOKEN_ROLES`</nobr>  | `false` | When `true`, roles extracted from OIDC tokens are persisted to the catalog database so they can be reused when the user is not the live caller — see [Token role provider](#token-role-provider) below. |

##### Token role provider

When `LAKEKEEPER__OPENID_ROLES_CLAIM` is set, Lakekeeper extracts roles directly from the authenticated user's JWT. A built-in token role provider is added to the chain **automatically** — no additional configuration is required.

The token role provider only applies to OIDC-authenticated users (those whose identity was established via the configured OpenID Connect provider). It is a no-op for users authenticated through other mechanisms (e.g. Kubernetes service accounts).

The provider uses the reserved identifier `oidc`. If you declare a role provider with this identifier in your configuration, the automatic provider is suppressed and your custom provider takes its place.

By default, token roles live only for the duration of the request — they are read from the JWT and never stored. This means they are unavailable for authorization decisions about a user who is **not** the current caller, most notably [DEFINER views](./view-security.md), where access is evaluated as the view's owner rather than the querying user.

Set `LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER_CHAIN__PERSIST_TOKEN_ROLES=true` to mirror each user's token roles into the catalog database. Persisted roles are then served whenever that user's permissions are evaluated while they are not the requesting caller — including DEFINER views.

On each request, the caller's token roles are compared against the stored set and written only when they differ; requests carrying unchanged roles do not write. A definer's roles are therefore as current as the most recent token that user presented. Roles are scoped to the project they were issued for: in multi-project deployments the owner must have presented a token for the project where the view lives. An empty roles claim is ignored rather than clearing the stored set.

##### LDAP role provider

Each LDAP provider is configured under a unique `<ID>` of your choosing. All variables below use the prefix `LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__<ID>__`.

**Required fields:**

| Variable                       | Example                                | Description |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----|
| <nobr>`…__TYPE`</nobr>         | `ldap`                                 | Provider type. Must be `ldap`. |
| <nobr>`…__URL`</nobr>          | `ldaps://ldap.example.com:636`         | LDAP server URL. Use `ldap://` for plain-text or STARTTLS, `ldaps://` for TLS. |
| <nobr>`…__DOMAINS`</nobr>      | `["example.com","*.corp.example.com"]` | JSON array of domain patterns. Only users whose login name ends with one of these domains are resolved via this provider. Supports `*` (any number of characters) and `?` (exactly one character). |
| <nobr>`…__USER_BASE_DN`</nobr> | `ou=people,dc=example,dc=com`          | Base DN for the LDAP user search. |

**Authentication:**

| Variable                        | Default     | Description                  |
|---------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------|
| <nobr>`…__BIND_DN`</nobr>       | (anonymous) | Distinguished name of the service account used to bind. Omit for anonymous bind. |
| <nobr>`…__BIND_PASSWORD`</nobr> |             | Password for the service account. Required when `…__BIND_DN` is set; can also be supplied via `…__BIND_PASSWORD_FILE`. |

**User search:**

| Variable                             | Default         | Description         |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| <nobr>`…__USER_SEARCH_FILTER`</nobr> | `(uid=${USER})` | LDAP filter used to locate a user entry. The literal `${USER}` is replaced with the subject portion of the user's login name (the part before `@`). |
| <nobr>`…__USER_SEARCH_SCOPE`</nobr>  | `sub`           | Search scope: `sub` (entire subtree), `one` (one level below base), or `base`. |

**Group / role mapping:**

The LDAP role provider supports three resolution modes, selected via `__GROUP_RESOLUTION_MODE`:

| Mode | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `attribute` *(default)* | Read group DNs directly from a `memberOf`-style attribute on the user entry. Correct for Active Directory / ADFS, OpenLDAP with the `memberof` overlay, and most setups where every user-of-interest has a populated `memberOf`. |
| `search` | Run a paged subtree LDAP search to find groups whose member attribute references the user. Useful for directories without `memberOf`, for filtering to a specific group name prefix (e.g. `ACME-*`) at the directory level instead of post-filtering, and for AD transitive resolution via `LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN`. |
| `branching` *(since 0.12.2)* | Per-user-DN branching: a regex tested against the user's DN selects between a Search-style filter (with named captures available as `${name}` placeholders) and an explicit `else` branch. |

The selector and shared fields:

| Variable                              | Default     | Description                                                                                            |
|---------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <nobr>`…__GROUP_RESOLUTION_MODE`</nobr> | `attribute` | One of `attribute`, `search`, or `branching`. The remaining fields depend on the mode you choose.    |
| <nobr>`…__GROUP_BASE_DN`</nobr>         |             | Base DN for the group search. Required by `search` and `branching`; ignored by `attribute`.            |
| <nobr>`…__GROUP_CASE`</nobr>            | `keep`      | Case transformation applied to the resolved group name before it is stored as a role. One of `keep`, `upper`, or `lower`. |

**Attribute mode (`group_resolution_mode = "attribute"`):**

| Variable                                   | Default    | Description        |
|--------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------|
| <nobr>`…__USER_MEMBER_OF_ATTRIBUTE`</nobr> | `memberOf` | Multi-valued attribute on the user entry that lists the groups the user belongs to. |
| <nobr>`…__GROUP_NAME_SOURCE`</nobr>        | `dn_cn`    | How to derive the role name from a group entry. `dn_cn` extracts the `CN=` component from the group's distinguished name (recommended for AD/ADFS). |

**Search mode (`group_resolution_mode = "search"`)** — *available since 0.12.2 with `${USER}` / `${DOMAIN}` placeholder support and the composed default filter*:

| Variable                                | Default                       | Description                                                                                            |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <nobr>`…__GROUP_SEARCH_FILTER`</nobr>     | `({GROUP_MEMBER_ATTRIBUTE}=${USER_DN})` | LDAP filter for the group search. May reference `${USER_DN}`, `${USER}`, and `${DOMAIN}` placeholders. When omitted, composed from `…__GROUP_MEMBER_ATTRIBUTE` — works on AD (`objectClass=group`), OpenLDAP (`groupOfNames` with `member`, or `groupOfUniqueNames` with `uniqueMember`), and 389-DS. For AD transitive resolution, set to `(member:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:=${USER_DN})`. |
| <nobr>`…__GROUP_MEMBER_ATTRIBUTE`</nobr>  | `member`                      | Attribute on the group entry that references members; drives the default filter when `…__GROUP_SEARCH_FILTER` is unset. Use `uniqueMember` for `groupOfUniqueNames` directories. |
| <nobr>`…__GROUP_NAME_ATTRIBUTE`</nobr>    | `cn`                          | Attribute on each returned group entry used as the role name. Use `sAMAccountName` for AD if you want the short name instead of the CN. |

**Branching mode (`group_resolution_mode = "branching"`)** — *available since 0.12.2* — per-user-DN dispatch between a Search-style `then` branch and an explicit `else` branch:

| Variable                                                 | Description |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| <nobr>`…__BRANCH_IF_USER_DN_MATCHES`</nobr>                | Regex tested against the user's DN (case-insensitive by default; prepend `(?-i)` for strict casing). Named captures `(?<name>…)` become `${name}` placeholders in the `then` filter. Reserved names `USER`, `DOMAIN`, `USER_DN` are rejected. |
| <nobr>`…__BRANCH_THEN__GROUP_SEARCH_FILTER`</nobr>         | LDAP filter for the `then` branch. May reference `${USER_DN}`, `${USER}`, `${DOMAIN}`, and any named capture from `…__BRANCH_IF_USER_DN_MATCHES`. Every placeholder must resolve at startup (unknown placeholders are rejected). |
| <nobr>`…__BRANCH_THEN__GROUP_MEMBER_ATTRIBUTE`</nobr>      | Same role as in Search mode — drives the default filter when `…__BRANCH_THEN__GROUP_SEARCH_FILTER` is unset. Defaults to `member`. |
| <nobr>`…__BRANCH_THEN__GROUP_NAME_ATTRIBUTE`</nobr>        | Attribute used as the role name for groups returned by the `then` branch. Defaults to `cn`. |
| <nobr>`…__BRANCH_ELSE__MODE`</nobr>                        | **Required.** One of `attribute` (run Attribute-mode resolution against the user entry) or `none` (return empty roles, emit `outcome = "dn_no_match"` to audit). No implicit default — pick explicitly so audit logs distinguish "no roles" from "no match". |
| <nobr>`…__BRANCH_ELSE__USER_MEMBER_OF_ATTRIBUTE`</nobr>    | When `…__BRANCH_ELSE__MODE=attribute`: the `memberOf`-style attribute to read. Defaults to `memberOf`. |
| <nobr>`…__BRANCH_ELSE__GROUP_NAME_SOURCE`</nobr>           | When `…__BRANCH_ELSE__MODE=attribute`: how to derive the role name. Defaults to `dn_cn`. |

!!! note "Capture-driven filters and cross-scope memberships"
    A capture-driven filter (e.g. `sAMAccountName=${tenant}*ABC-*`) constrains resolution to the captured value; memberships outside that scope are not returned. For cross-scope memberships, add another role provider in the chain with a broader filter.

!!! note "AD primary group is never returned"
    Active Directory's primary group (typically `Domain Users`, identified by `primaryGroupID` rather than a `member` link) is not returned by any mode — `memberOf` omits it and `LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN` does not walk it. To expose it as a Lakekeeper role, add explicit `member` entries in the directory.

!!! note "Regex is case-insensitive; `${USER_DN}` preserves directory casing"
    `…__BRANCH_IF_USER_DN_MATCHES` is compiled case-insensitive by default (prepend `(?-i)` to make it strict). The DN substituted into `${USER_DN}` is escaped per RFC 4515 and inserted with the casing the directory returned. DN-typed attribute predicates (`member=`, `memberOf=`, …) match server-side regardless of case.

!!! note "`group_base_dn` is always required in branching mode"
    Set `…__GROUP_BASE_DN` even if you expect every user to take the `else.mode = attribute` branch — the validator can't know which branch a given user will hit. Use the same value you would use in Search mode.

!!! warning "Role cache persists across restarts; changing modes does not invalidate it"
    Role assignments are cached in the catalog database, not just in process memory. Restarting Lakekeeper with a new `group_resolution_mode` does **not** invalidate the DB cache — users keep their previously-resolved roles for up to `…__SYNC_INTERVAL_SECS`. During a config rollout, either lower `…__SYNC_INTERVAL_SECS` temporarily or flush the role-assignments table for the affected provider.

**Example — Search mode with AD transitive resolution:**
```bash
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__CORP_AD__GROUP_RESOLUTION_MODE=search
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__CORP_AD__GROUP_BASE_DN=dc=corp,dc=example,dc=com
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__CORP_AD__GROUP_SEARCH_FILTER='(&(sAMAccountName=ACME-*)(member:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:=${USER_DN}))'
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__CORP_AD__GROUP_NAME_ATTRIBUTE=sAMAccountName
```

**Example — Branching mode (tenant users → tenant-scoped search; service accounts → `memberOf`):**
```bash
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__CORP_AD__GROUP_RESOLUTION_MODE=branching
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__CORP_AD__GROUP_BASE_DN=dc=corp,dc=example,dc=com

# Extract the tenant code from the user's DN (the OU directly below OU=Tenants)
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__CORP_AD__BRANCH_IF_USER_DN_MATCHES='OU=(?<tenant>[^,]+),OU=Tenants,'

# THEN branch — tenant users get tenant-scoped, transitively-resolved roles
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__CORP_AD__BRANCH_THEN__GROUP_SEARCH_FILTER='(&(sAMAccountName=${tenant}-ACME-*)(member:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:=${USER_DN}))'
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__CORP_AD__BRANCH_THEN__GROUP_NAME_ATTRIBUTE=sAMAccountName

# ELSE branch — service accounts under OU=Service fall back to memberOf
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__CORP_AD__BRANCH_ELSE__MODE=attribute
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__CORP_AD__BRANCH_ELSE__USER_MEMBER_OF_ATTRIBUTE=memberOf
```

**Connection and TLS:**

| Variable                               | Default | Description               |
|----------------------------------------|---------|---------------------------|
| <nobr>`…__STARTTLS`</nobr>             | `false` | Upgrade a plain TCP connection with STARTTLS before binding. Only applies to `ldap://` URLs. |
| <nobr>`…__ALLOW_INSECURE`</nobr>       | `false` | Skip TLS certificate verification. **Do not use in production.** |
| <nobr>`…__CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECS`</nobr> | `30`    | Seconds to wait when establishing the initial connection. |
| <nobr>`…__READ_TIMEOUT_SECS`</nobr>    | `60`    | Seconds to wait for an LDAP response. |

**Caching & performance:**

Each LDAP provider uses a two-layer cache to avoid a network round-trip to the LDAP server on every request:

1. **In-memory layer** — role assignments are held in a per-node moka cache (see [User Assignments Cache](#caching) above). Reads that hit this layer incur no I/O at all.
2. **Database layer** — on an in-memory miss, role assignments are read from (and re-populate) the database. The database record includes a `synced_at` timestamp that is compared against `SYNC_INTERVAL_SECS` to decide whether the data is still fresh.

If the database record is older than `SYNC_INTERVAL_SECS`, Lakekeeper contacts LDAP, writes the fresh assignments back to both the database and the in-memory cache, and returns the result. If LDAP is temporarily unreachable, the stale database record is served instead and an audit warning is emitted — the request is never failed solely due to an LDAP outage.

| Variable                             | Default | Description                 |
|--------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------|
| <nobr>`…__SYNC_INTERVAL_SECS`</nobr> | `300`   | Maximum age (in seconds) of a cached role-assignment record before Lakekeeper re-fetches from LDAP. Increase to reduce LDAP traffic; decrease when group membership changes must propagate more quickly. Also controls the TTL of the corresponding database record. |

**Startup and resilience:**

| Variable                                       | Default | Description       |
|------------------------------------------------|---------|-------------------|
| <nobr>`…__REQUIRE_CONNECTED_ON_STARTUP`</nobr> | `false` | When `true`, Lakekeeper refuses to start if this provider cannot connect. Useful for catching misconfiguration early. When `false`, the provider starts in a disconnected state and reconnects automatically on first use. |
| <nobr>`…__RECONNECT_COOLDOWN_SECS`</nobr>      | `30`    | Minimum seconds between reconnection attempts after a failure. |

**IDP filtering (optional):**

| Variable                  | Default      | Description                       |
|---------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| <nobr>`…__IDP_IDS`</nobr> | *(all IDPs)* | JSON array of identity provider IDs. When set, only users from these IDPs are resolved via this provider. Omit to allow all IDPs. |

**Example — minimal LDAP provider (env vars):**
```bash
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__MY_LDAP__TYPE=ldap
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__MY_LDAP__URL=ldaps://ldap.corp.example.com:636
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__MY_LDAP__DOMAINS=["corp.example.com"]
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__MY_LDAP__USER_BASE_DN=ou=people,dc=corp,dc=example,dc=com
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__MY_LDAP__BIND_DN=cn=svc-lakekeeper,ou=service-accounts,dc=corp,dc=example,dc=com
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__MY_LDAP__BIND_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/ldap-password
```

##### Microsoft Graph (Entra ID) role provider

*Available since Lakekeeper Plus 0.13.0*

Resolves a user's **transitive** Microsoft Entra ID group memberships via the Microsoft Graph API and maps each group to a role — keyed by the group's object id, with the group `displayName` as the role name. Each provider is configured under a unique `<ID>` of your choosing; all variables use the prefix `LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__<ID>__`.

The app registration this provider authenticates as needs the Microsoft Graph **application** permissions `GroupMember.Read.All` and `User.Read.All`, admin-consented.

**Required fields:**

| Variable | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| <nobr>`…__TYPE`</nobr>              | `entra-graph` | Provider type. Must be `entra-graph` (aliases: `entra_graph`, `azure-ad`). |
| <nobr>`…__CREDENTIAL__METHOD`</nobr> | `secret`      | Azure credential type — one of `secret`, `certificate`, `managed_identity`, `workload_identity`. Selects the remaining `…__CREDENTIAL__*` fields below. |

**Credential** — the `…__CREDENTIAL__*` fields depend on `…__CREDENTIAL__METHOD`:

| Method | Fields |
|--------|--------|
| <nobr>`secret`</nobr>            | `…__CREDENTIAL__TENANT_ID`, `…__CREDENTIAL__CLIENT_ID`, `…__CREDENTIAL__CLIENT_SECRET` (all required) |
| <nobr>`certificate`</nobr>       | `…__CREDENTIAL__TENANT_ID`, `…__CREDENTIAL__CLIENT_ID`, `…__CREDENTIAL__CERTIFICATE_PATH` (PKCS#12 / PFX, read at startup); optional `…__CREDENTIAL__CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` |
| <nobr>`managed_identity`</nobr>  | Omit `…__CREDENTIAL__USER_ASSIGNED_ID` for the system-assigned identity. For a user-assigned identity set `…__CREDENTIAL__USER_ASSIGNED_ID__KIND` (`client_id`, `object_id`, or `resource_id`) and `…__CREDENTIAL__USER_ASSIGNED_ID__VALUE`. |
| <nobr>`workload_identity`</nobr> | Optional `…__CREDENTIAL__TENANT_ID`, `…__CREDENTIAL__CLIENT_ID`, `…__CREDENTIAL__TOKEN_FILE_PATH`; each falls back to the standard `AZURE_*` environment variables when omitted. |

**Cloud / endpoints:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| <nobr>`…__CLOUD`</nobr>          | `public`       | Sovereign cloud: `public`, `us_government`, `china`, or `custom`. Drives the default Graph endpoint and the token authority. |
| <nobr>`…__GRAPH_BASE`</nobr>     | *(per cloud)*  | Microsoft Graph endpoint base. Overrides the cloud default; **required** for `custom`. |
| <nobr>`…__AUTHORITY_HOST`</nobr> | *(per cloud)*  | Entra ID token authority. Overrides the cloud default (e.g. a national-cloud proxy); **required** for `custom`. |

Built-in cloud endpoints:

| Cloud | Graph base | Authority |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| <nobr>`public`</nobr>        | `https://graph.microsoft.com`              | `https://login.microsoftonline.com` |
| <nobr>`us_government`</nobr> | `https://graph.microsoft.us`               | `https://login.microsoftonline.us`  |
| <nobr>`china`</nobr>         | `https://microsoftgraph.chinacloudapi.cn`  | `https://login.chinacloudapi.cn`    |
| <nobr>`custom`</nobr>        | *(none — set `…__GRAPH_BASE`)*             | *(none — set `…__AUTHORITY_HOST`)*  |

**HTTP timeouts:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| <nobr>`…__CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECS`</nobr> | `10` | Seconds to wait when establishing a connection to Graph. |
| <nobr>`…__REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS`</nobr> | `30` | Seconds to wait for a Graph response. |

Transient failures (`429` honoring `Retry-After`, transient `5xx`, and connection/timeout errors) are retried a few times with exponential backoff before the request fails and the cache falls back to the last good result. Outbound requests honor the standard `HTTPS_PROXY` / `HTTP_PROXY` / `NO_PROXY` environment variables.

**Caching:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| <nobr>`…__SYNC_INTERVAL_SECS`</nobr> | `300` | Maximum age of a cached role-assignment record before Lakekeeper re-fetches from Graph. Uses the same two-layer (in-memory + database) cache as the LDAP provider, including stale-fallback on a Graph outage. |

**Startup:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| <nobr>`…__REQUIRE_CONNECTED_ON_STARTUP`</nobr> | `false` | When `true`, Lakekeeper refuses to start if it cannot acquire a Graph token on startup. |

**IDP filtering (optional):**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| <nobr>`…__IDP_IDS`</nobr> | *(all IDPs)* | JSON array of **OIDC provider** IDs — the IdP a user logged in through, i.e. the default provider's reserved id `oidc`, or a [multi-OIDC](./authentication.md#multiple-oidc-providers) provider's configured id. When set, only users who authenticated via those providers are resolved here. Omit to handle all — Entra subjects are object ids and carry no domain to filter on. |

**Example — client-secret credential (env vars):**
```bash
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__ENTRA__TYPE=entra-graph
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__ENTRA__CREDENTIAL__METHOD=secret
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__ENTRA__CREDENTIAL__TENANT_ID=<tenant-guid>
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__ENTRA__CREDENTIAL__CLIENT_ID=<app-client-id>
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__ENTRA__CREDENTIAL__CLIENT_SECRET=<app-client-secret>
# Only resolve users who logged in via the OIDC provider with id `oidc`
# (the default provider's reserved id; a multi-OIDC provider uses its own id).
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__ENTRA__IDP_IDS=["oidc"]
```

##### Okta role provider

*Available since Lakekeeper Plus 0.13.1*

Resolves a user's Okta group memberships via the Okta management API and maps each group to a role — keyed by the group's immutable `id`, with the group `profile.name` as the role name and `profile.description` as the description. Okta groups are flat, so a single call returns the user's effective membership (direct plus group-rule assignments). Each provider is configured under a unique `<ID>` of your choosing; all variables use the prefix `LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__<ID>__`.

Authentication uses OAuth 2.0 client-credentials with a **private-key-JWT** client assertion — the only client-auth method Okta supports for org-scoped service apps. No static client secret is stored.

**Okta setup:** In the Admin Console, create an **API Services** app integration. Under General → Client Credentials, set Client authentication to **Public key / Private key** and **Save keys in Okta**, then **Generate new key** and copy the private key (Okta shows a JWK by default; click **PEM** for PEM) — this is your only chance to save it. Grant the app the `okta.users.read` scope (admin-consented), and under **Admin roles** assign a **read-only admin role** (e.g. Read-only Administrator).

**Required fields:**

| Variable | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| <nobr>`…__TYPE`</nobr>      | `okta`                    | Provider type. Must be `okta`. |
| <nobr>`…__ORG_URL`</nobr>   | `https://acme.okta.com`   | Okta org base URL. Must use `https`. Base for both the token endpoint and the API. |
| <nobr>`…__CLIENT_ID`</nobr> | `0oa…`                    | The service app's client id. |

**Signing key** — supply the service app's private key via exactly one of:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| <nobr>`…__PRIVATE_KEY`</nobr>      | Inline private key — the JWK (Okta's default "Copy to clipboard") **or** a PEM block. |
| <nobr>`…__PRIVATE_KEY_FILE`</nobr> | Path to a file holding the private key (JWK or PEM), read at startup. |
| <nobr>`…__KEY_ID`</nobr>           | Public key id. **Required** when the key is PEM; a JWK carries its own `kid`. |

**Scopes (optional):**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| <nobr>`…__SCOPES`</nobr> | `["okta.users.read"]` | JSON array of OAuth scopes requested for the token. |

**HTTP timeouts:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| <nobr>`…__CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECS`</nobr> | `10` | Seconds to wait when establishing a connection to Okta. |
| <nobr>`…__REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS`</nobr> | `30` | Seconds to wait for an Okta response. |

Transient failures (`429` honoring `Retry-After`, transient `5xx`, and connection/timeout errors) are retried a few times with exponential backoff before the request fails and the cache falls back to the last good result. Outbound requests honor the standard `HTTPS_PROXY` / `HTTP_PROXY` / `NO_PROXY` environment variables.

**Caching:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| <nobr>`…__SYNC_INTERVAL_SECS`</nobr> | `300` | Maximum age of a cached role-assignment record before Lakekeeper re-fetches from Okta. Uses the same two-layer (in-memory + database) cache as the LDAP and Entra providers, including stale-fallback on an Okta outage. |

**Startup:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| <nobr>`…__REQUIRE_CONNECTED_ON_STARTUP`</nobr> | `false` | When `true`, Lakekeeper refuses to start if it cannot acquire an Okta token on startup. |

**DPoP:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| <nobr>`…__DPOP`</nobr> | `true` | Sender-constrain the access token with [DPoP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9449) (RFC 9449): each token and API request carries an ES256 proof signed by an ephemeral in-memory key, so a leaked token is useless without it. Okta accepts DPoP whether or not the app has *Require DPoP* set, so leave it on. Set `false` only if an org rejects DPoP. |

**IDP filtering (optional):**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| <nobr>`…__IDP_IDS`</nobr> | *(all IDPs)* | JSON array of **OIDC provider** IDs — the IdP a user logged in through, i.e. the default provider's reserved id `oidc`, or a [multi-OIDC](./authentication.md#multiple-oidc-providers) provider's configured id. When set, only users who authenticated via those providers are resolved here. Omit to handle all — Okta subjects are user ids and carry no domain to filter on. |

**Example — inline JWK key (env vars):**
```bash
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__OKTA__TYPE=okta
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__OKTA__ORG_URL=https://acme.okta.com
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__OKTA__CLIENT_ID=<service-app-client-id>
# The JWK Okta shows on "Generate new key" (carries its own kid):
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__OKTA__PRIVATE_KEY='{"kty":"RSA","kid":"…","n":"…","e":"AQAB","d":"…","p":"…","q":"…"}'
# Only resolve users who logged in via the OIDC provider with id `oidc`:
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__OKTA__IDP_IDS=["oidc"]
```

For a PEM key, click **PEM** when copying the key, then supply it plus its Key ID:
```bash
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__OKTA__PRIVATE_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/okta-key.pem
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__OKTA__KEY_ID=<public-key-id>
```

##### File-based configuration

All providers can alternatively be configured through a single TOML file. This is convenient when secrets management or config management tools produce a single artefact (e.g. Vault agent, Kubernetes projected volumes, Ansible templates).

Point `LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER_FILE` at a standard TOML file. Each provider is a section `[role_provider.<id>]` where `<id>` is the provider ID you choose. Multiple providers can be defined in the same file.

**Example — two LDAP providers in one file:**

`/etc/lakekeeper/role-providers.toml`:
```toml
[role_provider.corporate]
type = "ldap"
url = "ldaps://ldap.corp.example.com:636"
domains = ["corp.example.com"]
user_base_dn = "ou=people,dc=corp,dc=example,dc=com"
bind_dn = "cn=svc-lakekeeper,ou=service-accounts,dc=corp,dc=example,dc=com"
bind_password = "s3cr3t"

[role_provider.subsidiary]
type = "ldap"
url = "ldaps://ldap.subsidiary.example.com:636"
domains = ["subsidiary.example.com"]
user_base_dn = "ou=users,dc=subsidiary,dc=example,dc=com"
bind_dn = "cn=svc-lakekeeper,ou=service-accounts,dc=subsidiary,dc=example,dc=com"
bind_password = "s3cr3t"
```

Then set the single environment variable:
```bash
LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER_FILE=/etc/lakekeeper/role-providers.toml
```

> **Combining file and environment variables:** The file and env-var approaches can be combined. The file is loaded first and env vars are merged on top — env vars override individual fields for the same provider while unset fields are preserved from the file. This makes it easy to store non-sensitive configuration in the file and inject secrets via env vars:
>
> ```toml
> # /etc/lakekeeper/role-providers.toml (checked in, no secrets)
> [role_provider.corporate]
> type = "ldap"
> url = "ldaps://ldap.corp.example.com:636"
> domains = ["corp.example.com"]
> user_base_dn = "ou=people,dc=corp,dc=example,dc=com"
> bind_dn = "cn=svc-lakekeeper,ou=service-accounts,dc=corp,dc=example,dc=com"
> ```
>
> ```bash
> # Injected at runtime (e.g. from a secrets manager)
> LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER_FILE=/etc/lakekeeper/role-providers.toml
> LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER__CORPORATE__BIND_PASSWORD=s3cr3t
> ```

### Tokio Runtime Metrics

Lakekeeper emits [Tokio Runtime Metrics](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio-metrics?tab=readme-ov-file#runtime-metrics) with a default report interval of 30 seconds. If necessary, this interval can be fine-tuned.

| Variable                                                   | Example | Description                                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__METRICS__TOKIO__REPORT_INTERVAL`</nobr> | `30s`   | Length of interval for which Tokio Runtime Metrics are collected and emitted. Default: `30s` |

### Debug

Lakekeeper provides debugging options to help troubleshoot issues during development. These options should **not** be enabled in production environments as they can expose sensitive data and impact performance.

| Variable                                                   | Example | Description |
|------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-------|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__DEBUG__LOG_REQUEST_BODIES`</nobr>       | `true`  | If set to `true`, Lakekeeper will log all incoming and outgoing request bodies at debug level. This is useful for debugging API interactions but should **never** be enabled in production as it can expose sensitive data (credentials, tokens, etc.) and significantly impact performance. Default: `false` |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__DEBUG__MIGRATE_BEFORE_SERVE`</nobr>     | `true`  | If set to `true`, Lakekeeper waits for the DB (30s) and runs migrations when `serve` is called. Default: `false` |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__DEBUG__AUTO_SERVE`</nobr>               | `true`  | If set to `true`, Lakekeeper will automatically start the server when no subcommand is provided (i.e., when running the binary without arguments). This is useful for development environments to quickly start the server without explicitly specifying the `serve` command. Default: `false` |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__DEBUG__EXTENDED_LOGS`</nobr>            | `false` | Controls whether file names and line numbers are included in JSON log output. When set to `false`, these fields are omitted for cleaner logs. When set to `true`, each log entry includes `filename` and `line_number` fields for easier debugging. Default: `false` |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__DEBUG__LOG_AUTHORIZATION_HEADER`</nobr> | `false` | If set to `true`, the `Authorization` header is included in request trace spans for the `/catalog/v1/config` and `/management/v1/info` endpoints. This exposes sensitive credentials (tokens, passwords) and should **never** be enabled in production. Default: `false` |

**Warning**: Debug options can expose sensitive information in logs and should only be used in secure development environments.

### Test Configurations
| Variable                                          | Example | Description    |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__SKIP_STORAGE_VALIDATION`<nobr> | true    | If set to true, Lakekeeper does not validate the provided storage configuration & credentials when creating or updating Warehouses. This is not suitable for production. Default: false |


### License Configuration
Lakekeeper Plus<nobr><span class="lkp"></span></nobr> requires a License to operate. The license can be provided via either of the following environment variables. If both are set, `LAKEKEEPER__LICENSE__KEY` takes precedence.

| Variable                                     | Example                | Description |
|----------------------------------------------|------------------------|------|
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__LICENSE__KEY`</nobr>      | `<license-key>`        | License key as a string. Takes precedence over `LAKEKEEPER__LICENSE__KEY_PATH` if both are set. |
| <nobr>`LAKEKEEPER__LICENSE__KEY_PATH`</nobr> | `/path/to/license.lic` | Path to a file containing the license key. |
