# Logging

## Overview

Lakekeeper emits structured JSON logs through the Rust `tracing` ecosystem. All logs include standard fields (`timestamp`, `level`, `message`, `target`) and can be filtered using the `RUST_LOG` environment variable.

## Controlling Log Output

### The RUST_LOG Environment Variable

The `RUST_LOG` variable controls which logs are emitted based on their **level** and **target** (the Rust module that produced the log). This applies to all log types including audit logs, error responses, and general application logs.

**Basic syntax:**
```bash
# Set global minimum level
RUST_LOG=info              # Show INFO, WARN, ERROR
RUST_LOG=debug             # Show DEBUG and above
RUST_LOG=warn              # Show only WARN and ERROR

# Filter by `target`
RUST_LOG=lakekeeper=debug                    # Debug for lakekeeper, nothing else
RUST_LOG=info,lakekeeper=debug               # INFO globally, DEBUG for lakekeeper
RUST_LOG=lakekeeper::service::events=trace   # Trace only the events module
```

For production environments, use `RUST_LOG=info` to avoid excessive log volume while capturing all important operational events. You can optionally reduce noise from verbose dependencies (e.g., `RUST_LOG=info,sqlx=warn`).

### Audit Logs and RUST_LOG

Audit logs are **enabled by default**. They will appear when `RUST_LOG` is set to `info` or higher (since audit logs are emitted at INFO level).

To disable audit logs entirely:

```bash
LAKEKEEPER__AUDIT__TRACING__ENABLED=false
```

**Note:** Audit logs contain PII. When disabling them, ensure you have alternative mechanisms for compliance and security monitoring.

## Log Types

Lakekeeper produces three types of logs, distinguished by the `event_source` field:

### 1. Audit Logs {#audit-logs}

Authorization events tracking access to catalog resources. **Contains PII** (user identities).

**Identified by:** `"event_source": "audit"`

Audit logs cover two distinct schemas depending on the source of the event:

#### Authorization Events

Emitted for every authz check. Always contain `action`/`actions`, `entity`/`entities`, `actor`, and `decision`.

**Structure:**

| Field                  | Type            | Description                       |
|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
| `event_source`         | String          | Always `"audit"`                  |
| `action` or `actions`  | Object or Array | Operation(s) attempted. Each action is an object with an `action_name` field (e.g., `"read_data"`, `"drop"`, `"create_namespace"`) and optional context fields (e.g., `properties`, `updated-properties`, `removed-properties`). See format below. |
| `entity` or `entities` | Object or Array | Resource(s) accessed, containing `entity_type` and type-specific fields (e.g., `warehouse-id`, `namespace`, `table`) |
| `actor`                | Object          | Who performed the action (see format below) |
| `privilege_source`     | String          | Request-level classification of the caller's privilege: `"authorizer"` (no special privileges — all decisions come from the configured Authorizer backend), `"instance_admin"` (caller listed in `LAKEKEEPER__INSTANCE_ADMINS` — control-plane actions are auto-approved, data-plane actions still go through the Authorizer), or `"internal"` (in-process call — full bypass). This is a property of the request, not of individual entries in the `authorizations` array. See [Instance Admins](./authorization.md#instance-admins). |
| `decision`             | String          | `"allowed"` or `"denied"` — the rollup decision for the whole event |
| `authorizations`       | Array           | Per-decision breakdown. Always present and non-empty. Each entry is self-contained — see [Per-decision breakdown](#per-decision-breakdown-authorizations) below |
| `context`              | Object          | Optional. Additional operation context (e.g., `project-id`, `warehouse-name`) |
| `failure_reason`       | Object          | Only on failed events. Single-key object identifying the variant — one of `{"ActionForbidden": []}`, `{"ResourceNotFound": []}`, `{"CannotSeeResource": []}`, `{"InternalAuthorizationError": []}`, `{"InternalCatalogError": []}`, `{"InvalidRequestData": []}`. The empty array is the variant payload. |
| `error`                | Object          | Only on failed events. Contains `type`, `message`, `code`, `error_id`, `stack` |

**Note:** Empty arrays and objects are omitted from the output. For example, if `stack` is empty, the field will not appear in the log.

**Ordering:** An authorization event records the *attempt*, and is dispatched to the audit log before the authorized operation issues its write. An `"allowed"` decision therefore means the caller was permitted to perform the action, not that the action succeeded — if the operation fails afterwards the request returns an error while the authorization event remains in the log. Audit consumers should treat authorization events as attempts rather than as confirmation that state changed.

**Actor Types:**

```json
// Anonymous
{"actor_type": "anonymous"}

// Authenticated user
{"actor_type": "principal", "principal": "oidc~user@example.com"}

// Assumed role
{"actor_type": "assumed-role", "principal": "oidc~user@example.com", "assumed_role": "role-id"}

// Internal system
{"actor_type": "lakekeeper-internal"}
```

**Action Format:**

Each action is a structured object containing the operation name and optional context about the operation:

```json
// Simple action (no context)
{"action_name": "read_data"}

// Action with properties context (e.g., create_namespace)
{"action_name": "create_namespace", "properties": {"location": "s3://bucket/ns", "owner": "alice"}}

// Action with update context (e.g., commit with property changes)
{"action_name": "commit", "updated-properties": {"retention-days": "30"}, "removed-properties": ["staging"]}
```

When only a single action is involved, it appears as the `action` field. When multiple actions are checked the `actions` field contains an array.

#### Per-decision breakdown (`authorizations`)

Every authorization event carries an `authorizations` array with **at least one entry**. For ordinary single-check API calls the array has exactly one entry, synthesised from the event's top-level fields. For batch-style endpoints (e.g. `/management/v1/action/batch-check` and the various `get_*_actions` introspection endpoints) the array contains one entry per inner check, in request order.

This means audit consumers can use **one query path** for both single and batch events: iterate `authorizations[]` and read the per-entry `allowed` flag, instead of switching between top-level `decision` and a per-batch breakdown.

Each entry is **self-contained** — it does not require zipping with the top-level fields:

| Field           | Type    | Description                                                                          |
|-----------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`            | String  | Stable identifier for this entry. When the client supplies an `id` on a batch-check input it appears verbatim here, and the API response echoes the same value so the two can be correlated 1:1. When the client omits `id`, the API response omits it too; the audit log instead substitutes the request item's zero-based index as an internal bookkeeping fallback so individual decisions can still be pinpointed in the logs. **Do not assume the API response carries index-based ids — that fallback exists only in audit entries.** Absent on synthesised single-check entries. |
| `for-principal` | Object  | Optional. The principal whose permission was evaluated, when different from the request actor. Shape: `{"user": "..."}` or `{"role": "..."}`. Absent means the request actor itself. |
| `action`        | Object  | Same shape as the top-level `action` field.                                          |
| `entity`        | Object  | Same shape as the top-level `entity` field.                                          |
| `allowed`       | Boolean | The decision for *this* tuple. Absent when no definitive verdict was reached — e.g. on `InternalAuthorizationError`, `InternalCatalogError`, or `InvalidRequestData` failures, where the system never actually evaluated the request. Definitive denials (`ActionForbidden`, `ResourceNotFound`, `CannotSeeResource`) are recorded as `false`. |
| `determined_by` | Array   | Optional; present only when the Authorizer surfaces per-decision diagnostics (some backends, e.g. OpenFGA and allow-all, produce none, and the field is then absent). Each element attributes *this* decision to a factor: a matched **policy** (carrying its identifier, an optional author-supplied name, an effect of `Permit` or `Forbid`, and an optional originating source), or a **system-authority override** (an optional source and human-readable reason) recording that a built-in/system authority tier — rather than a configured policy — determined the allow, e.g. a recovery grant that lets a privileged system role act despite a policy that would otherwise forbid it. Distinct from the top-level `privilege_source`, which classifies the caller rather than individual decisions. |

**Top-level vs. per-entry semantics.** The top-level `actor` always reflects the *API caller* (the bearer token holder); `authorizations[].for-principal` reflects *whose permissions were checked*. For most calls these are the same and `for-principal` is omitted. For introspection endpoints like `GET /lakekeeper/v1/permissions/...?for-user=X` the actor is the caller while every entry's `for-principal` is `X` — both facts are recorded structurally on the same event, no `context.for-user` string needed.

#### Operational Audit Events

Emitted for non-authz operations that touch user identity (PII) — such as LDAP/directory role resolution and user enrichment. Use these to audit *what the system fetched on behalf of a user*, rather than *whether the user was allowed to do something*.

**Structure:**

| Field          | Type   | Description                                        |
|----------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `event_source` | String | Always `"audit"`                                   |
| `operation`    | String | Machine-readable name of the operation (e.g., `"ldap_resolve_roles"`) |
| `actor`        | Object | Same shape as authorization events: `{"actor_type": "principal", "principal": "oidc~…"}` |
| `outcome`      | String | Result of the operation. Component-specific; see individual operation docs below |
| `context`      | Object | Optional. Operation-specific metadata (e.g., `provider_id`, `role_count`) |

**Outcomes are not binary allow/deny** — they describe the result of the system operation. No `decision` field is present.

**LDAP role resolution (`operation = "ldap_resolve_roles"`):**

| `outcome`        | When emitted                                              |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `success`        | User found and role list resolved (possibly empty after mapping) |
| `user_not_found` | No LDAP entry matched the search filter for this subject  |
| `no_roles`       | User entry exists but the group-membership attribute is absent |
| `ambiguous_user` *(since 0.12.2)* | LDAP search matched more than one entry for the subject; request errors out |
| `dn_no_match` *(since 0.12.2)* | `Branching` mode with `else.mode = none`: the user DN did not match `branch_if_user_dn_matches`; empty role list returned |

*Since 0.12.2*, every `ldap_resolve_roles` context carries a `mode` field describing which resolution path was active. Possible values:

| `mode`                  | Meaning                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `search`                | Stand-alone Search-mode resolution                                                                      |
| `attribute`             | Stand-alone Attribute-mode resolution                                                                   |
| `branching`             | Branching mode, but no branch decision was reached (e.g. `user_not_found`)                              |
| `branch_then`           | Branching mode `then` branch ran (DN matched the regex)                                                 |
| `branch_else_attribute` | Branching mode `else.mode = attribute` ran (DN did not match)                                           |
| `branch_else_none`      | Branching mode `else.mode = none` (only emitted alongside `outcome = "dn_no_match"`)                    |

**PII in context fields.** `filter` (substituted with the user's subject), `user_dn`, and `principal` are PII. `provider_id`, `attribute`, `pattern`, `role_count`, `count`, and `mode` are not.

**Role resolution (`operation = "resolve_roles"`):**

| `outcome`                | When emitted                                      |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `no_provider_applicable` | No configured role provider matched this user.    |
| `roles_resolved`         | At least one role was resolved. Disabled by default — enable with `LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER_CHAIN__LOG_ROLE_ASSIGNMENTS=true`. The `context` contains `role_count`, the full `roles` list, and `sources` showing where each provider's roles came from (`fresh`, `cache_hit`, `stale_fallback`, or `in_request`). |
| `error`                  | A matched provider failed to resolve roles (e.g. LDAP connection error). The request proceeds with an empty role set. |

The `no_provider_applicable` outcome is enabled by default and can be controlled via `LAKEKEEPER__ROLE_PROVIDER_CHAIN__LOG_UNHANDLED_USERS`. A `no_provider_applicable` outcome for a user that you expect to be covered indicates a misconfigured domain filter or a missing provider. Set the variable to `false` to suppress these events if some users are intentionally not covered.

The `roles_resolved` outcome is **disabled by default** because it fires on every authenticated request and contains the full list of resolved role names. Enable it temporarily to debug role-provider configuration — do not leave it on in production.

The `error` outcome always fires when role resolution fails. It is accompanied by a general application warning in the non-audit log stream (without PII).

**Role assignment cache (`operation = "cached_role_provider"`):**

| `outcome`             | When emitted                                                            |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `stale_cache_fallback` | One or more providers failed to refresh; stale DB-cached roles are returned instead. The `context.provider_ids` field lists the affected providers. |

This outcome is always accompanied by a WARN-level general log (without PII) and indicates a transient connectivity issue with the role provider (e.g. LDAP unavailable). The user receives their last-known roles rather than an error.

**jq filters for operational audit events:**

```bash
# All LDAP resolution events
cat logs.json | jq -R 'fromjson? | select(.event_source == "audit" and .operation == "ldap_resolve_roles")'

# Users not found in LDAP (misconfigured filter or unknown principals)
cat logs.json | jq -R 'fromjson? | select(.event_source == "audit" and .outcome == "user_not_found")'

# Successful resolutions for a specific user
cat logs.json | jq -R 'fromjson? | select(.event_source == "audit" and .operation == "ldap_resolve_roles" and .actor.principal == "oidc~user@example.com")'

# Users not matched by any role provider
cat logs.json | jq -R 'fromjson? | select(.event_source == "audit" and .outcome == "no_provider_applicable")'

# Stale cache fallbacks (role provider unreachable, last-known roles served)
cat logs.json | jq -R 'fromjson? | select(.event_source == "audit" and .outcome == "stale_cache_fallback")'
```


### 2. Error Response Logs

HTTP error responses returned to clients. **Does not contain PII.**

**Identified by:** `"event_source": "error_response"`

**Structure:**

| Field          | Type   | Description                                        |
|----------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `event_source` | String | Always `"error_response"`                          |
| `error`        | Object | Contains `type`, `code`, `message`, `error_id`, `stack`, `source` |

**Note:** Empty arrays are omitted. If `stack` or `source` are empty, they will not appear in the log.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-02-15T14:22:15.456789Z",
  "level": "ERROR",
  "event_source": "error_response",
  "error": {
    "type": "TableNotFound",
    "code": 404,
    "message": "Table 'my_table' not found in namespace 'production'",
    "error_id": "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef",
    "stack": ["Additional context here"],
    "source": ["Caused by: ..."]
  },
  "message": "Internal server error response",
  "target": "iceberg_ext::catalog::rest::error"
}
```

**Note:** For 5xx errors, the `stack` and `source` fields are logged but hidden from the HTTP response body for security.

### 3. General Application Logs

Standard operational and debug logs from Lakekeeper. No `event_source` field.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-02-15T14:20:42.425131Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "message": "Authorization model for version 4.3 found in OpenFGA store lakekeeper. Model ID: 01KHGMK6TQKN1AVMWX16E37AD1",
  "target": "openfga_client::migration"
}
```

## Additional Configuration

### Extended Debug Logs

Include source file locations and line numbers in logs:

```bash
LAKEKEEPER__DEBUG__EXTENDED_LOGS=true
```

This is useful for debugging but increases log size.

## Filtering Logs

Use `jq` to filter structured JSON logs. Lakekeeper outputs non-JSON content during startup (ASCII art banner, version info), so standard `jq` will fail. Use `jq -R 'fromjson?'` to handle mixed output:

- `-R` reads each line as raw text instead of expecting JSON
- `fromjson?` attempts to parse each line as JSON, silently skipping non-JSON lines (the `?` suppresses errors)

```bash
# Only audit logs
cat logs.json | jq -R 'fromjson? | select(.event_source == "audit")'

# Failed authorizations
cat logs.json | jq -R 'fromjson? | select(.event_source == "audit" and .decision == "denied")'

# Error responses
cat logs.json | jq -R 'fromjson? | select(.event_source == "error_response")'

# Specific user activity
cat logs.json | jq -R 'fromjson? | select(.event_source == "audit" and .actor.principal == "oidc~user@example.com")'

# Specific table access
cat logs.json | jq -R 'fromjson? | select(.event_source == "audit" and .entity.table == "my_table")'

# Any individual denied decision (single-check OR a denied entry inside a batch event)
cat logs.json | jq -R 'fromjson? | select(.event_source == "audit" and any((.authorizations // [])[]; .allowed == false))'

# Permissions checked on behalf of a specific user (introspection / batch-check)
cat logs.json | jq -R 'fromjson? | select(.event_source == "audit" and any((.authorizations // [])[]; .["for-principal"].user == "oidc~cfb55bf6-fcbb-4a1e-bfec-30c6649b52f8"))'
```

## Best Practices

1. **Separate Audit Logs**: Route logs with `event_source=audit` to a secure, long-term storage system for compliance.

2. **PII Handling**: Audit logs contain user identities. Apply appropriate access controls and retention policies.

3. **Error IDs**: Every error has a unique `error_id`. Use this to correlate client-side errors with server logs.

4. **Log Aggregation**: In production, use a centralized logging system (ELK, Loki, Splunk) to collect and analyze logs from all Lakekeeper instances.

5. **Alerts**: Set up alerts for:
   - Multiple `decision=denied` events from the same principal
   - High rates of `event_source=error_response` with 5xx codes
   - Access to sensitive resources outside business hours
