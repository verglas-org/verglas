//! Role-membership management API: the direct `/role/{id}/members`,
//! `/role/{id}/member-of` and `/user/{id}/roles` surface.
//!
//! A role's members are **polymorphic** — a member is either a user (a direct
//! user→role assignment) or another role (a role→role membership edge). Both are
//! surfaced through one `/members` collection, each entry tagged by a `type`
//! discriminator (see [`RoleMember`]).
//!
//! Read & write dispatch is **mutually exclusive / single-source-of-truth**: when
//! the authorizer manages assignments (e.g. OpenFGA, via
//! [`Authorizer::role_assignments`]) the edges live in the authorizer's store;
//! otherwise (Cedar/AllowAll) they live in the catalog tables. The authorizer arm
//! reads id-only rows and hydrates role identity from the catalog. The hot authz
//! path is untouched; all of this is cold-path management code.
//!
//! **Backend divergence (cold reads).** The two arms return the same membership
//! *set* but are not otherwise identical: the authorizer arm hydrates role
//! identity through the role cache (see [`fetch_roles_by_ids`]), so a just-renamed
//! role may render a stale display name until the cache TTL elapses (display only
//! — never the authorization decision); and the two arms order results
//! differently, emit mutually-opaque page tokens, and may cap page size
//! differently (the authorizer backend can clamp lower). Treat the page token as
//! opaque and don't assume a cross-backend result order.
//!
//! **Direct vs transitive coverage.** The three *direct* reads (`/members`,
//! `/member-of`, `/user/{id}/roles`) are implemented on both arms. The three
//! *transitive* reads are implemented on the **catalog arm only** (a
//! lazily-paginated recursive SQL CTE); under an assignment-managing authorizer
//! they return `501` — see [`transitive_listing_not_supported_under_authorizer`]
//! for why OpenFGA's graph-listing APIs make a correct, bounded transitive
//! listing impractical today.
//!
//! **Authorization scope.** The *direct* role reads check the per-role
//! `ReadRoleAssignments` — they expose only the named role's own edges, which that
//! check covers. The *transitive* role reads (`/members/transitive`,
//! `/member-of/transitive`) instead require the PROJECT-scoped `ListRoles`
//! capability, because they return a whole closure of *other* roles' members /
//! ancestors. Gating that on one per-role check would, under a per-role authorizer
//! (Cedar), let a grant on the entry role authorize disclosure of nested/ancestor
//! roles the caller cannot read individually. `ListRoles` is the right gate: in the
//! OpenFGA model `role.can_read_assignments` already resolves to
//! `can_list_roles from project`, so reading role assignments is project-uniform by
//! design (no per-role read grant exists) — see `authz/openfga/.../role.fga`. The
//! `/user/{id}/roles/transitive` read stays on the per-user `ReadRoleAssignments`
//! (server-level under OpenFGA): its closure is the *user's own* effective roles,
//! which is exactly the data that check authorizes.
//!
//! **Cross-project nesting divergence.** The catalog forbids role-in-role
//! membership across projects at write time (`add_role_members` →
//! `RoleIdNotFoundInProject`) and its readers are project-scoped. An
//! assignment-managing authorizer (OpenFGA) writes id-only edges with no such
//! check, so a cross-project edge can exist there; the authorizer-arm readers
//! therefore hydrate identity **across projects** (see [`fetch_roles_by_ids`])
//! and faithfully return cross-project members, dropping only ids with no catalog
//! row anywhere (a truly dangling tuple). The listing reflects the authorizer's
//! actual graph rather than re-imposing the catalog's project scoping.
//!
//! Error/emit shape follows `user.rs::get_user`: emit the authorization decision,
//! then run business logic with `?`.
