/// `EventListener` is a trait that allows for custom listeners to be executed after successful
/// completion of various operations.
///
/// # Naming Convention
///
/// All listener methods use past-tense verbs to indicate they fire after successful operations:
/// - `table_created` - fires after a table has been successfully created
/// - `table_dropped` - fires after a table has been successfully dropped
/// - etc.
///
/// This naming pattern enables future extension with additional lifecycle phases:
/// - Error listeners: `table_create_failed`, `table_drop_failed`
/// - Pre-operation listeners: `before_table_create`, `before_table_drop`
/// - Read listeners: `table_loaded`, `table_listed`
///
/// # Implementation Guidelines
///
/// The default implementation of every listener method does nothing. Override any function if you want to
/// implement it.
///
/// An implementation should be light-weight, ideally every longer running task is deferred to a
/// background task via a channel or is spawned as a tokio task.
///
/// `EventListener` implementations are passed into the services via the [`EventDispatcher`]. If you want
/// to provide your own implementation, you'll have to fork and modify the main function to include
/// your listeners.
///
/// If the listener fails, it will be logged, but the request will continue to process. This is to ensure
/// that the request is not blocked by a listener failure.
